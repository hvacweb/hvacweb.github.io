<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Big Rapids MI 49307</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Individuals working at Target aren't lazy or dumb and in this company all it takes is one small fracture in your defenses and somebody will discover it and pry you broad open, in some cases in just a few days.
