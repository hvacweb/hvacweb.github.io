<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it exhausts warm air out the top, don't position the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any airflow limitation will lower the system's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
