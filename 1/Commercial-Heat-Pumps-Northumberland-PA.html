<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, many of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Nevertheless, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible for the most part, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the launched spores.

More major than most allergenic properties is the ability of mold to set off episodes personallies that already have asthma, a major respiratory disease.<p>
