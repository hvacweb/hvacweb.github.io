<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
