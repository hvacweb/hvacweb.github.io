<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump cost is even more than other heat pump types when setting up the entire system. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.
