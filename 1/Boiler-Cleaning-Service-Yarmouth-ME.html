<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it exhausts warm air out the top, do not position the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it. Any airflow restriction will decrease the unit's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
