<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually.

In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
