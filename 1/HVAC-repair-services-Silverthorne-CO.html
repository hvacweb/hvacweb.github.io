<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Silverthorne CO</h3>
<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that deals with indoor air quality issues. In the absence of such legislation, the "basic task stipulation" applies. This stipulation, typical to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, specifies that an employer needs to supply a healthy and safe workplace. Hence, ensuring the air is of great quality is the employer's responsibility.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
