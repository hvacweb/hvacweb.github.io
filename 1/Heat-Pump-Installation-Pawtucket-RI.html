<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
