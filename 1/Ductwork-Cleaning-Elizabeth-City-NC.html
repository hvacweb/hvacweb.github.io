<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in collecting details on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
