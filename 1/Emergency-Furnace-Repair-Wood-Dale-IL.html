<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems in houses. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, flooring drains, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon becomes caught in concentrations and buildings build up indoors.<p>
