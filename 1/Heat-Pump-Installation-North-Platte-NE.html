<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While space a/c supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>

<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable organic compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally occurring chemical substances. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the structure (e.g., workplace equipment; furnishings, wall and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>

The building type consisted of both residential and commercial. The majority of samples analyzed were tested favorable for bacteria and fungis.<p>
