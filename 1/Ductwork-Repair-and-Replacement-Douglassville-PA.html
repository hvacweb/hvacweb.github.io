EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke triggers nose, eye, and throat inflammation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually connected exposure to previously owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort.

The radiators may be mounted on walls or set up within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
