<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens found in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of feline allergen might induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
