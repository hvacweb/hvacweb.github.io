<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Canton IL</h3>
<p>Among the main reasons a furnace will run continuously is since something is filthy or clogged Before attempting to fix any problem, take some time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". Check the furnace blower for obstructing and tidy it if the air filter is excellent to go. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it if this does not work. If you still can not determine why your furnace keeps running, contact a skilled technician.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
