<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
