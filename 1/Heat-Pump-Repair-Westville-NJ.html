<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>When asbestos-containing material is damaged or breaks down, tiny fibers are distributed into the air.
