<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them till they have actually been properly dried. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>

<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
