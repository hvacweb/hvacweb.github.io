<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
