<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, because some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
