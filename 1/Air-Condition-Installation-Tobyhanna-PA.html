<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable greater airflow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and new air purification innovations are ending up being more common as available services in residential and commercial HVAC item packages. Adoption of these technologies, however, has not been widespread, as customers stay largely oblivious to the effects of air quality on health and productivity.<p>
<p>Many AC systems feature a variety of unique features that can further enhance efficiency and performance. For example, house owners may want to search for one that comes with a built-in filter light that will notify you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular function to search for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to minimize energy costs even more. Naturally, more features mean greater central air conditioning costs.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
