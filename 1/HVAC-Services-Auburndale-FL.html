<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
