<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
