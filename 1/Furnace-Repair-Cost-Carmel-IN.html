<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract..
