<h3>Electric Furnace in Caribou ME 04736</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not come on. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent possibility; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate go bad on unusual celebrations.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.

Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
