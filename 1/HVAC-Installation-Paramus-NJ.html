<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
