<p>Homeowners might also presume that due to the fact that a glowing flooring heating system can be seen (and financed) as a house improvement, its installation will immediately raise their home's value. No proof exists suggesting that in-floor heating either favorably or adversely impacts property worths. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Worth Report provided by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Remodeling Magazine. Perhaps Realtors must consider too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heating system may contribute to, or subtract from, any given asking rate. That said, property buyers looking to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heating unit will want to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
