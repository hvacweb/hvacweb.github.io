<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can end up being obstructed with particles that can limit air flow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's performance. Unclean filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down entirely.

As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
