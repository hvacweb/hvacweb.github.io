<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
