<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely practical in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
