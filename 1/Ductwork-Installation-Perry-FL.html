Secondly, there should not be any challenges en route of the air flow that might avoid it from covering the space of the facilities as much as possible. The outdoor system must likewise be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be efficiently released outdoors and the efficiency of the entire system will drop dramatically.

<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
