<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally uncommon now.

<p>Geothermal heatpump cost is much more than other heat pump types when setting up the whole system. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.
