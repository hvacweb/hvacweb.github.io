<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price great but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
