<p>The primary health result associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
