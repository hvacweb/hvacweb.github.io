As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
