<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again. He is truthful, dependable, and sensible on price. It's difficult to discover an honest AC person and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads.

Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis.
