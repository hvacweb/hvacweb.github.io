<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
