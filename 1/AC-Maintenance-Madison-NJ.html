<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the go to. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty.
