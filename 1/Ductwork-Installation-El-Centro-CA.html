<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
