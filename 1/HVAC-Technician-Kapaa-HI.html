<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Kapaa HI</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12.

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioning system, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be allowed to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to keep and understand.<p>
