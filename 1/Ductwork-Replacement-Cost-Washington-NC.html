<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested informing me about our system, and left having solved the issue with an easy repair he did on-site, not changing the entire part. He was friendly, simple and a completely pleasurable individual to have around that entire time. His time and competence to SOLVE the concern cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a somewhat unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
