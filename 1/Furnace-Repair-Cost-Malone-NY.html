<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.
