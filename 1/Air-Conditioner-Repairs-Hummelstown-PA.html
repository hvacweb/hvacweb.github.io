If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
