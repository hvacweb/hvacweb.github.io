<p>Immediate impacts may appear after a single exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are usually short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is just getting rid of the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also show up soon after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
