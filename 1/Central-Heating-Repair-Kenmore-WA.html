<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level.

When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
