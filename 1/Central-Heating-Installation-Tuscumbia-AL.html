<p>Regularly, indoor air quality issues in big commercial structures can not be effectively determined or corrected without a comprehensive building examination. These investigations may start with written surveys and telephone consultations in which building detectives examine the history of resident signs and building operation treatments. In some cases, these inquiries may quickly discover the problem and on-site visits are unnecessary.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more tough to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
