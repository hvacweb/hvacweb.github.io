<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted 2 local companies for bids. While both were informative and practical, Ballard Gas offered us a better offer, for exceptional service. Instead of a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating system and located ways we could have more even heat.

Because of current warmer summertimes and for environmental factors, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>You could update to the greatest performance equipment available and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are just part of the central air system.
