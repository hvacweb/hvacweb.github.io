<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>

ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
