<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to offer adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
