<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Harrison OH</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in home building is to minimize air leak through fractures and other openings in roofs, walls, and floorings. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
