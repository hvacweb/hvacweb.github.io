<p>Before you go out and buy an air conditioner, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be installing the ac system? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioner be? Too big and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning unit and shorten its life. Too small and your air conditioning system will not be able to cool your house effectively. These are just a few of the elements that you need to take into account when buying a brand-new AC system. Each option can and will substantially affect your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to overlook any of them.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
