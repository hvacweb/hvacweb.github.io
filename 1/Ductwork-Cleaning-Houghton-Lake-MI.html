<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Company in Houghton Lake</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside workplaces, schools, and other work environments is important not only for employees' comfort but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been tied to symptoms like headaches, tiredness, problem focusing, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some specific diseases have actually been linked to particular air contaminants or indoor environments, like asthma with damp indoor environments. In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause immediate signs but can lead to cancer after several years.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in houses through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floorings, flooring drains, and sumps. When radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and buildings build up inside, exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>
