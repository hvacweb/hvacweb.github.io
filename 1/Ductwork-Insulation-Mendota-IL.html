<p>Prior to you select a contractor, consider bids from a minimum of 3 to 5 reputable contractors. Check with your state's contractor's licensing board online to ensure that no consumer problems have actually been filed which the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is active and valid. Compare the various furnace effectiveness scores suggested by the individual contractors to pick the design and system that best fits your energy requires.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
