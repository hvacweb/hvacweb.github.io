Usage fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls work to make sure the fans run for a sufficient time period.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a reference later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
