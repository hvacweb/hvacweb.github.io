<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a big merchant who asked not to be called because he did not have consent to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a group that regularly monitors energy consumption and temperature levels in stores to minimize expenses (particularly in the evening) and to alert store supervisors if temperature levels in the stores fluctuate beyond an appropriate range that could prevent consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have several control boards. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard.

Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t correctly diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
