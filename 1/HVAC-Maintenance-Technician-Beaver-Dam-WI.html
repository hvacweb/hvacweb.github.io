<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise an option for property owners to think about. Many times, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, because the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are generally only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability.

Therefore, this may not be the best choice for house owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
