<h3>Truth About Denville NJ Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit need relatively little attention. But, as with any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is necessary to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be checked for leaks, the system ought to be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in hard water locations). The systems must be examined at least twice per year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to remove dust gathered in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
