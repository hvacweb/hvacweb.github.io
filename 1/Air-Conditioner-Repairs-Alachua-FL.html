<p>. Before picking the installation location of air conditioner, several main factors need to be considered. First of all, the instructions of air circulation from the indoor units need to not fall on the location of rest or work area. Secondly, there should not be any obstacles en route of the air flow that may avoid it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible. The outside unit needs to also be located in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be successfully released outdoors and the productivity of the entire system will drop greatly. It is extremely suggested to install the air conditioner systems in quickly accessible locations, for further maintenance during operation.<p>
