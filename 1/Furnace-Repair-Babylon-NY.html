<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Babylon NY 11702</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>

<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might observe musty or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
