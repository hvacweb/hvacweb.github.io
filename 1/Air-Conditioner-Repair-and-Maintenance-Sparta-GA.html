<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product with time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
