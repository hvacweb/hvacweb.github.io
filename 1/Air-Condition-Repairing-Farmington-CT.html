<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to provide enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
