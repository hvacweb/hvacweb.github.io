Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>

<p>. Before picking the installation location of ac system, numerous primary elements require to be thought about. To start with, the direction of air flow from the indoor systems ought to not fall on the location of rest or workspace.

<p>If the AC does not shut off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the unit running.

Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
