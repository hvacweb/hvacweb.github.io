<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
