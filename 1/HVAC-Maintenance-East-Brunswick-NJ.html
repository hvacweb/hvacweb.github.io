<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be quickly integrated with existing systems such as standard forced air or radiant flooring heating or can be set up in a new structure. Required air systems will require a water-to-air heatpump while hydronic radiant heat systems will require water-to-water heat pumps.

Capability for geothermal systems is determined in loads.

Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can assist you appropriately size a system.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room a/c supplies maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more pricey than central air.<p>
