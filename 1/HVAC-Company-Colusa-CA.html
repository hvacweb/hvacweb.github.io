<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Picture 6).<p>

Radon problems in water can be easily fixed. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>Through regular usage and the unit's existence outside, the coils and fins of the a/c unit may become really dirty. These aspects of the equipment are essential for effective air conditioning. The technician cleans all elements, and examines connections to ensure they are safe and secure. The system is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic parts are examineded for correct function and general condition. This is an excellent chance to identify parts that are worn or malfunctioning. When the problem is relatively small, changing them to fix the air conditioning may be a lot less costly.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ might notice unpleasant or musty smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, speak with your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
