<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>The installation was quick, expert and very well done. The installers were courteous and understood exactly what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and acknowledge quickly people who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are great and do not miss information that produces a task extremely well done. I extremely highly suggest the two gentlemen as they are excellent at what they do. Thank you to them as they definitely deserve my thanks and gratitude for a task well done.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
