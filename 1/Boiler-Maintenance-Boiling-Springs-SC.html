<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Photo 6).<p>

<p>These principles-- and determination to suffer through the heat-- may currently be changing. Though only 33 percent of Seattle real estate systems had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 new housing units have actually been integrated in the 4 years given that or are presently under building. The large bulk of these units are mixed-use or multi-family, where a/c is more of an industry standard, says Scott Vollmoeller of engineering firm Glumac.<p>

This kind of air conditioning unit also is utilized in small commercial structures. Air supply and return ducts come from inside your home through the home's outside wall or roofing to connect with the packaged a/c, which is typically situated outdoors. Packaged ac system typically include electric heating coils or a gas furnace. This mix of air conditioning unit and central heating unit gets rid of the need for a different furnace inside.<p>
<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably typical, you can expect a minimum of thirty days throughout which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 last year! Just a couple of years back, Seattle saw a record temperature of 103 degrees, and there have actually been a lot of long, dry, hot streaks since then. A central air system in your home means you have the power to change the temperature level to a consistent temperature level when the heat gets excruciating.<p>
