<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise a choice for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, given that the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best choice for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
