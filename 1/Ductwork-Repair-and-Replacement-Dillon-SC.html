<h3>Everything You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair in Dillon SC</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is a really enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Inspect these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
