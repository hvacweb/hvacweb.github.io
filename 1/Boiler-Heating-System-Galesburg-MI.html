<p>The primary health effect connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
