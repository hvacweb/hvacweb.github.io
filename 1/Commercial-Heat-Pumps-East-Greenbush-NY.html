<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in East Greenbush NY</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
