<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should evaluate and, if needed, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more effective solution to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>

<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was sort of strange being that package was opened and products might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged.

I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
