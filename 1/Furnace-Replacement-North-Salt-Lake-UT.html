<p>Professional heating system setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately fail. HVAC experts recommend following this basic rule when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance gos to annually, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and generally some other advantages. Some companies use priority appointments to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
