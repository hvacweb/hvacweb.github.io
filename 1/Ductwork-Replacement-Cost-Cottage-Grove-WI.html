<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Cottage Grove WI?</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions necessitate.

Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
