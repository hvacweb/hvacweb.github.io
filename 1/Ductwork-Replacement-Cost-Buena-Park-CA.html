<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material over time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
