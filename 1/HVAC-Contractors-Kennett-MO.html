<p>In addition, worker health signs such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, irritation, and irregular breathing might be caused as the outcome of temperature level extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and insufficient or too much air circulation. Work environment temperature levels need to be kept between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air blood circulation should be avoided.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the performance and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor carefully, many of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement attempts to upsell you each time they come to perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for 7 years, although it was six months before the current one expired. She didn't require a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
