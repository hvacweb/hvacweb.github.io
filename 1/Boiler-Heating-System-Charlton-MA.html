These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). POLICE rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling result.
