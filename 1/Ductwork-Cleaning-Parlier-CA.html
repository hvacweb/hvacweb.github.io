<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated performance advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Since they don't require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions.

Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for monetary flexibility.

A common component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
