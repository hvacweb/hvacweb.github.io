<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>I generally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the problem and fixed very quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
