<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
