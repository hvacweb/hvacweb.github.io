<h3>Passive Ventilation in Sullivan Illinois</h3>

<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
