<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
