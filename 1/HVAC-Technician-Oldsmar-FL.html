They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to order it. My better half stated that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent people I have fulfilled in a very long time.
