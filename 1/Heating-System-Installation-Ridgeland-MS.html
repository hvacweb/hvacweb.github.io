<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
