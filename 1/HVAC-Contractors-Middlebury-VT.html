The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating system. We selected getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
