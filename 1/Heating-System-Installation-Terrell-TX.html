<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can likewise intensify indoor air quality problems.
