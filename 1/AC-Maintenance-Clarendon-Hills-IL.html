<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, considering that it is secured inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, however numerous utilize the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better service. If the existing system has not sustained other major repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and problems that resulted in the breakdown can be recognized and corrected, repairing the system can make a lot of sense also.<p>
