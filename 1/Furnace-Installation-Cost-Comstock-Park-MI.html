We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
