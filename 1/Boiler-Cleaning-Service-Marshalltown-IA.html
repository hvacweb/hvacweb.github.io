<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
