<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
