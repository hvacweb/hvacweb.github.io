The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house.

Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

They require a tank on the immediate residential or commercial property and more maintenance. Overall, they cost between $2,000 and $8,000 to set up. In general, they offer an AFUE ranking of in between 80 and 90 percent.<p>
