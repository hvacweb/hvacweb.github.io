<h3>The Way to Get Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing in Veneta OR</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely delighted that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to test the a/c unit prior to you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
