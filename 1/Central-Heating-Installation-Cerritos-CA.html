<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from usage.

Heating systems that kick on frequently might be because of a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
