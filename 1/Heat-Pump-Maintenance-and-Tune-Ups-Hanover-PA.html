<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Your Evaluation This is my 3rd time using All the time.

I have nothing but fantastic things to say - he has actually taken excellent care of my heating and AC needs. Quick action - fast resolution.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might select to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the brand-new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor system. Nevertheless, considering recent modifications in refrigerants and cooling designs, it might be smarter to replace the whole system.<p>
