<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>

<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the evaporator, compressor, and condenser are all situated in one cabinet, which generally is placed on a roofing or on a concrete slab beside your house's structure.

<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
