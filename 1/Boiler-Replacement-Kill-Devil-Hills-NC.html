After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
