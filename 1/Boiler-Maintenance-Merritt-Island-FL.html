<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific however Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Professional HVAC service technicians suggest locals of the City of Redmond have access to cooling and heating systems inside their houses. During the summer and winter seasons, central air units and heating systems supply enough cooling and heating power to homes in Redmond.
