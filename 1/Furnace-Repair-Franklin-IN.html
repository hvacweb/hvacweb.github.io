Producers generally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance contracts after the new basic enters into effect.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and cooling company.
