<h3>AC Repair Contractor in Hazard KY 41701</h3>
<p>Do you need to repair or replace part of your home's HVAC system? With those warm Washington summer seasons and cold winters, it is important for your home to be geared up with a high-performing heating and cooling system throughout the year. Whether you need an evaluation, repair, installation or maintenance for your HVAC system, you can depend on the professionals at AAA Heating & A/c to do the job right.<p>
<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
