Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heaters-- although ceiling radiators are almost always used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>

Too big and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioner and reduce its life. Too small and your a/c unit won't be able to cool the house effectively. When going shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are simply a few of the aspects that you require to take into account. Each option can and will substantially impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to neglect any of them.<p>
