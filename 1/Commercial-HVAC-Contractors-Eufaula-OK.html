<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Remember, too, that you may want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities.

For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one major downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or extremely hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
