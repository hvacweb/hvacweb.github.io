<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the potential to adversely affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and very little particles of dust.

For instance, he may seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more reliable option to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
