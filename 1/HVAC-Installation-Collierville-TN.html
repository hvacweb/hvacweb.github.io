<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>

<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Collierville TN 38017</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they identified the issue and repaired very rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials.
