<p>All Points Heating provides home air conditioning, air conditioning unit installation, air conditioner maintenance that deliver dependable, tested efficiency at high performance. Combustion items from car exhaust, heaters, water heaters, space heaters, scented candles, oil lights, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not effectively vented can create carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion items might lead to eye, nose, and throat inflammation; fatigue; dizziness; and nausea.<p>

<h3>What to Search for When Selecting an Dawson GA HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in house building and construction is to decrease air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, floors, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air assists and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the home.<p>
