<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious. They consist of delays in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Babies, kids, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults because lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the destructive impacts of lead. Kids might have greater direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
