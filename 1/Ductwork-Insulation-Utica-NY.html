Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
