Sources of formaldehyde in the house include structure materials, cigarette smoking, family products, and using unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in produced items. For example, it is utilized to include permanent-press qualities to clothes and draperies, as a component of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and covering items.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no pollutant sources are discovered. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions.

When ventilation is not adequate to account for a boost in the number of employees in the area, stale air may likewise be an issue.<p>

<p>Air conditioners can develop a lot of water since they get rid of wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
