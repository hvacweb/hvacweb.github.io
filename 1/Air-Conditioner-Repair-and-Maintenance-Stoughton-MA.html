Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
