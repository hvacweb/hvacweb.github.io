The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

<h3>Water Boiler Repair in Mims FL 32754</h3>

I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
