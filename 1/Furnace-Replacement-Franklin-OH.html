Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. Try a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
