Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are often used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was extremely extensive and on-time in discussing what services would be performed.
