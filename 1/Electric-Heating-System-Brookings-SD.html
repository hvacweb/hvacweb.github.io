<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
