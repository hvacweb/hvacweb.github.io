<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.
