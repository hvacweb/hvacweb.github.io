<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
