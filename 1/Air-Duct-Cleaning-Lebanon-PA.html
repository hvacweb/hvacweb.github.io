<h3>AC Repair Cost in Lebanon PA 17042</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
