<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Chillicothe IL 61523</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
