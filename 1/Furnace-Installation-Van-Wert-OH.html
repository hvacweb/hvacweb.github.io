"Humidifier fever" is a common health problem caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Different fungi and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these contaminants can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the structure residents. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are animals and household plants.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
