After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Room air conditioning system feature a thermostat sensor, situated behind the control panel, which measures the temperature level of air entering into the evaporative coil. The air conditioner might cycle continuously or act unpredictably if the sensing unit is knocked out of position. The sensing unit must be near the coil however not touching it; adjust its position by thoroughly bending the wire that holds it in location.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
