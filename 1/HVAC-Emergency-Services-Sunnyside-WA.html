A furnace that is too small, on the other hand, will not be able to provide adequate heat to keep your house comfortable.<p>
<p>The majority of people don't realize that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break gradually. That can compromise the performance of the system and eventually harm it enough that you require to invest in furnace replacement or AC replacement.

For instance, a heat exchanger may fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, causing holes and fractures. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.  a really helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
