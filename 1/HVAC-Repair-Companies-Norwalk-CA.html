<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Because up to 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated efficiency advantage. Ductless heatpump are fantastic for additions because they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
