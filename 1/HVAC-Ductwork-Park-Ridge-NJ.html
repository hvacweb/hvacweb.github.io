Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
