<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Kingman AZ 86409</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
