<p>In basic, ductless AC systems are more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient than conventional A/cs. This is since you can switch off individual rooms when you're not inhabiting them. On top of that, ductless A/cs can raise and reduce their temperature quickly, conserving you energy and money that regular HVAC compressors will squander by continuously launching and turning themselves off.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really practical in gathering info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
