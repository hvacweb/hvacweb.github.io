A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Car Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>

To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator requires handled by experts, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
