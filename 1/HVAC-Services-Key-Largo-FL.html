<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices maker's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place. In addition, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one response mentioned the cost savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the result of recurring usage of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, resulting in cracks and holes. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.  a very advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
