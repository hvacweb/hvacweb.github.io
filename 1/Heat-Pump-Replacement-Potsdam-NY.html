<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
