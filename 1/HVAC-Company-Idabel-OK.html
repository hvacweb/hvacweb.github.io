<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, but to have two major parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>This is my third time using All the time. Ilan constantly makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is knowledgeable with these devices). I have absolutely nothing but great things to state - he has actually taken excellent care of my heating and AC needs. Quick action - quick resolution.<p>
<p>Firstly, The after hours addressing service representative, John, was professional and really respectful. Secondly, Gracion W is a prompt, well-informed technician. He was at my home within the time he gave me, fixed the problem while explaining the concern then remained numerous minutes to ensure it was working effectively. The issue was repaired in a matter of time that I've never ever seen prior to while being a house owner for ten years. I also recommend one of the Defense Strategies, which I belong to, if you like to save cash. Thank you." Karen P.<p>
