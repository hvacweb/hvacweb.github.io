<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as near the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
