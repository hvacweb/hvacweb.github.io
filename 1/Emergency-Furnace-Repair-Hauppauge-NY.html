<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air.

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
