<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
