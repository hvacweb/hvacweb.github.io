<h3>What to Look for When Selecting an Salem IL HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are extremely efficient, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a constant temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling result. Many ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
