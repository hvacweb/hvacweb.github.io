<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>Installed rate reflects the most common average installed cost throughout the U.S.A. for a 3 Heap unit. Rate may vary in your area. Cost varies will apply to Fundamental Installation to include basic materials and service, which may vary by the type of system or system element selected. All rate ranges undergo adjustment based upon the special attributes of the home. Any adjustments or changes to Standard Installation concurred upon by Purchaser will be an extra cost as worked out by Purchaser and the independent Trane Convenience Specialist including the cost of mechanical licenses that might be needed by local and state law. Price ranges do not include any taxes, now or hereafter enacted. Taxes will be added by your Trane Comfort Professional to the prices to abide by federal and local tax law.<p>
