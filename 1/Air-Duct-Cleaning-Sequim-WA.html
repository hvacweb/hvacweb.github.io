<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is generally higher than numerous heatpump options, they can still be extremely effective, depending on the design you acquire.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
