<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

You might also be tracking in lead from soil around your home. Soil very close to homes may be polluted from lead paint on the outside of the structure. Soil by roads and highways may be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that utilized leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet before entering the house. Alter your clothes prior to you go house and clean these clothing individually if you work with lead in your job or a hobby. Motivate your kids to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which sticks to toys and fingers. Try to keep your children from eating dirt, and make sure they clean their hands when they come within.<p>
