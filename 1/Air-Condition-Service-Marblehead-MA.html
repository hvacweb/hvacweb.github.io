The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step.

What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in place. Moreover, the concrete results of a PM is typically difficult to quantify, as one response specified the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided.

If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.  an extremely useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
