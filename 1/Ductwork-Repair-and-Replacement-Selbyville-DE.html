<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
