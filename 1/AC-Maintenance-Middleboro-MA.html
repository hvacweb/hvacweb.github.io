<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner at Middleboro MA</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of replacing or exchanging air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates unpleasant smells and extreme wetness, introduces outside air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
