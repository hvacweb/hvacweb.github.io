<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
