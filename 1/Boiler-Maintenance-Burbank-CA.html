<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Burbank CA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
