<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Furnace in Oklahoma City OK</h3>
<p>Designed to enhance making process control in a printing plant, Carrier's innovation managed not only temperature however also humidity Carrier used his understanding of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the procedure. Rather of sending out air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the space controllable. The regulated temperature level and humidity assisted preserve constant paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later on, Carrier's technology was used to increase productivity in the workplace, and The Provider Cooling Company of America was formed to meet rising demand. With time, air conditioning became utilized to improve comfort in homes and automobiles as well.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
