According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Apartment or condos can have the very same indoor air problems as single-family houses due to the fact that much of the pollution sources, such as the interior building materials, furnishings, and home products, are comparable.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
