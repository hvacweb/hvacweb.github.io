<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as vital as a regular oil modification in your cars and truck. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. During high use months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

The lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
