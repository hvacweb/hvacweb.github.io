<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil.
