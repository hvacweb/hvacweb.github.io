<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, as opposed to outdoor or industrial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.
