<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Heat Exchanger Replacement: â $ " Â The heat exchanger is at the very core of the furnace.
