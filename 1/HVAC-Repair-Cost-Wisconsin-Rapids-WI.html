<p>Normally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
