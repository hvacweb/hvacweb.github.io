<p>Specific instant effects resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often difficult to determine if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is very important to take notice of the time and place signs occur. If the signs fade or go away when an individual is away from the location, for instance, an effort must be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes.

<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
