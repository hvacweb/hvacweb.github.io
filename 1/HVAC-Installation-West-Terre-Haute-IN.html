The lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was blocked.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might go into close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
