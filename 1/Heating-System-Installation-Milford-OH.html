<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we recommend utilizing our insulation boards. When used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a really efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of enabling heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
