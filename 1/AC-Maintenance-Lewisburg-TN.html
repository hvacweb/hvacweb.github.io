<h3>Is Your Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Lewisburg TN?</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house building and construction is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, floorings, and walls.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
