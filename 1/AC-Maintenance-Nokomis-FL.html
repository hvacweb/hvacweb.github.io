And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
