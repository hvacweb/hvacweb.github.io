When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to stress over a thing.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on different home efficiency upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's product and services was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to perform the required electrical enhancements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work.

No extra charge.<p>
