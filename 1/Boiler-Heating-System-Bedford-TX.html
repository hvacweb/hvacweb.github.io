<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day.

He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
