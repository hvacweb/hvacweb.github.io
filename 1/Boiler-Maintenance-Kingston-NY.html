<p>Through typical usage and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning system might become very filthy.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold.
