<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
