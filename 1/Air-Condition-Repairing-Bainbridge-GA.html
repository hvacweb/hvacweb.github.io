<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil.
