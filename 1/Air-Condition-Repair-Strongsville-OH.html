<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>

Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates.
