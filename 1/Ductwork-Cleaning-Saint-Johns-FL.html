<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
