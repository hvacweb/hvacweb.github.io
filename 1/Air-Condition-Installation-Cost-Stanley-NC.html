<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Stanley NC</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in house construction is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floors. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
