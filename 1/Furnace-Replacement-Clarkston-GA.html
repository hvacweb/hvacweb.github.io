<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>Lots of people underestimate the extent of the indoor air pollution problem. Air pollution is normally visualized as the black smoke given off from factories. Little idea is given to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, paints, pesticides, and cleaners utilized in the home.
