<p>Sean was really useful. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
