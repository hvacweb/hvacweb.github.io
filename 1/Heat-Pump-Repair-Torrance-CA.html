<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the math recently, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they should be positioned. Most commonly they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if people mostly remain seated in that particular area. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the flooring or ceiling; depending upon what pollutant you're attempting to track you'll need to place the sensor appropriately. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside structures are usually near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>
