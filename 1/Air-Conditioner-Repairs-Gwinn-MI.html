<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
