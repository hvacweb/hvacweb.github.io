<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
