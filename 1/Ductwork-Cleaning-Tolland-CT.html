<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
