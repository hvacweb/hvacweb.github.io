<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most economical if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
