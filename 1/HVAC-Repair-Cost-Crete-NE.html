<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Crete NE</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>There's a huge difference in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical kind of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, most of homes in chillier environments were heated up by convection, instead of radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the floors, walls and ceilings heated. In turn, the things in the space, like furniture and individuals, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
