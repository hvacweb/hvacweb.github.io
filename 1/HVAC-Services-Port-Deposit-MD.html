<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives typically amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the preliminary rate of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, during new building and construction (homes generally use in between one and five lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. However, new installation practices are lowering costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>

<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heatpump work best in a mild environment, where the temperature level does not get too low or too high. In other words, they are perfect for our Seattle climate! They are highly effective, vanquishing most other kinds of heating systems in performance. The only genuine exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. Nevertheless, a geothermal installation normally costs tens of thousands more than an air source heatpump, which normally implies it fails in terms of return on investment.<p>
