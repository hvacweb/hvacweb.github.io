Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers.
