<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years ago and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you must check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
