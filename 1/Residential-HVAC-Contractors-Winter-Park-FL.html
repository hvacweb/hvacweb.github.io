<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Winter Park FL</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different house efficiency upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.)

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly.

A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
