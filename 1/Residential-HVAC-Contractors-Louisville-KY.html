<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems in houses. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the home. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>For instance, impurities may gather within the air diffusers and grills, presenting toxins into the environment. Or if the outdoor air intake lies near a source of moisture or other outside toxin, it may function as a path to carry the pollutants inside. Or the ventilation system might not be working along with it must-- if debris is blocking the outside air consumption, for example, or the filters are contaminated or poorly preserved.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
