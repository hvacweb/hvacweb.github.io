<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters homes through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. When radon ends up being trapped in structures and concentrations build up inside, direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioning And Heating Companies in Southaven MS 38671</h3>
<p>Research respectable building and improvement firms in your area and offer to be a reliable HVAC resource. Because they build houses and commercial buildings from the ground up, residential and commercial building contractors might be your finest long-term leads. Remodelling project managers may desire a HVAC specialist to determine if a heating or air conditioning unit should be repaired or replaced. These firms may likewise need guidance on which ENERGY STAR equipment is the very best fit for the size of a newly developed house.<p>
<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in big commercial buildings can not be effectively identified or corrected without an extensive structure examination. These investigations may begin with written questionnaires and telephone consultations in which structure investigators assess the history of resident symptoms and structure operation treatments. In many cases, these inquiries may rapidly reveal the issue and on-site sees are unneeded.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more challenging to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
