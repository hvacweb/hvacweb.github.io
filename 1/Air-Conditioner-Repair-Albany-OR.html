<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the cooling. I proceeded and purchased this Carrier and I should say it does the job quite well. It takes really little time to heat up or cool off your home which is among the things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had in the past. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
