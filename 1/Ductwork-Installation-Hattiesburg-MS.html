<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle.

<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices maker's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in place. Additionally, the concrete outcomes of a PM is frequently tough to quantify, as one response mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repeated use of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature deterioration, causing fractures and holes. , if that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.. a really beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
