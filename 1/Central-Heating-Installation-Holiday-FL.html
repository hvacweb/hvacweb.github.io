<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>

Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.
