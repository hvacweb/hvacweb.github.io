<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if necessary, upgrade the structure envelope.
