Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout brand-new building (homes normally use between one and five tons).

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

I have them carry out a yearly tune-up & the a number of times I've needed a service call, Ilan was able always able to fit me in the very same day.
