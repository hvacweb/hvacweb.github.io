<h3>How to Get Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing in Mars PA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We decided on getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
