<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
