<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your house that perfect temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service strategy which typically includes a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
