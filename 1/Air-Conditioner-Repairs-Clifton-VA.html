<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise managing the temperature level of the floor.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
