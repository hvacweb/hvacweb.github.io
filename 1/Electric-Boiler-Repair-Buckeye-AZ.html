<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, however a homeowner does not have the abilities or tools necessary to examine refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, however homeowners do not have the required equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still needed to have an expert technician check the system occasionally.<p>
<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors.

(Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
