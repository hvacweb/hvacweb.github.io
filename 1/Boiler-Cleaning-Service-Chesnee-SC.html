<h3>HVAC Systems Are a Must for All Homes and Offices in Chesnee SC</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using wise technology. Martin said the company can establish a dashboard within the building's controls that will offer information on its systems to permit real time exposure, providing the ability to be preventative rather than reactionary. This service can be supplied to any commercial customer, not simply during new construction.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
