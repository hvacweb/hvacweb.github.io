<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating components installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, occasionally linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems.

Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>

<p>Another pollutant of indoor air is outside air. At the height of the pollen season or when the air quality index is unhealthy, people with asthma may find being indoors provides the very best relief, if the indoor air environment is excellent. Although cooling does not filter the air, it helps people with asthma because doors and windows are kept shut, which helps keep pollens and other outdoor irritants and allergens out of the house. A sudden shift in temperature from warm to cold can also an asthma attack.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating system does not generate its power by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, or gas. Rather, it absorbs heat from within the earth.

<p>Outside pollutants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and allergens discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates.
