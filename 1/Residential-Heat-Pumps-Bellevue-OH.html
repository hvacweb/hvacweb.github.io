<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the a/c into a heat pump While space cooling provides optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is typically more costly than central air.<p>
