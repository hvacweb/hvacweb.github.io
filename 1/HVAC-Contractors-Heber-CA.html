<p>Bear in mind that the SEER ranking is calculated using the same set of temperature levels across the board. The average summer temperature level to get to the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to get to the correct SEER score for your location, deduct 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER ranking needs to be at least 13 for all brand-new a/c systems produced in the United States.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
