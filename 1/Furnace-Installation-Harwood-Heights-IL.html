<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
