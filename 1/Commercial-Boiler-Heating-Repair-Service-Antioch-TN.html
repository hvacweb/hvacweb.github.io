<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

YORK products are backed by some of the very best restricted warranties in the business, including YORK's factory-backed warranty.
