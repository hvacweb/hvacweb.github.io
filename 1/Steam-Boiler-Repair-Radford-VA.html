<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Radford VA?</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
