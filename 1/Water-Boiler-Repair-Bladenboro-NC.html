<p>To be honest, few of the facilities supervisors who utilize our indoor air quality tracking service pertained to us for that reason. Typically they were initially interested in remotely keeping an eye on some other element of their buildings, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't until later, as they continued working with us, that they discovered and carried out indoor air quality monitoring to offer a healthier, much safer building environment-- and to head off the unfavorable consequences connected with indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>More frequently, however, investigators will need to come to the building to perform personal interviews with residents, to look for possible sources of the problems, and to check the design and operation of the ventilation system and other building functions. Since taking measurements of pollutants at the really low levels frequently found in office buildings is costly and may not yield details easily helpful in recognizing problem sources, private investigators might not take lots of measurements. The process of solving indoor air quality problems that lead to health and convenience problems can be a sluggish one, involving several trial services before effective remedial actions are determined.<p>
