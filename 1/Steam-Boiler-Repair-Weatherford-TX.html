It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with newcomers more accustomed to AC living.

<p>Immediate effects might show up after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate impacts are treatable and normally short-term.

<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are used to seeing this key in the yards of homes. With split system units, most of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the house. However, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple rooms at the same time, but are not really energy effective.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
