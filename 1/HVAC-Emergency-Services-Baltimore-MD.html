<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>
