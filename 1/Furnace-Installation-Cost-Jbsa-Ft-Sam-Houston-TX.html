<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an option for property owners to consider. Many times, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system individually, given that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capability.
