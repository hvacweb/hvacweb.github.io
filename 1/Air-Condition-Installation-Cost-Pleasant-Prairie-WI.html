Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed simply a few years earlier.<p>

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

Any disturbance or disruption in the circulation of electricity makes the system inoperable. This is one of the drawbacks to installing an electric radiant heat system. However, assuming they are installed properly and effectively looked after, the likelihood of them having issues is small.<p>
