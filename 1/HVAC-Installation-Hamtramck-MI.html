Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
