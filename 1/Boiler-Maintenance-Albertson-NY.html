In many split-system air conditioners, this indoor cabinet also includes a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump.

If your home already has no air but a furnace conditioner, a split-system is the most affordable central air conditioner to set up.<p>

<p>A primary factor in the avoidance of health signs is an efficient, appropriately created and running ventilation system.
