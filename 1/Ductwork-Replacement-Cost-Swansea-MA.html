<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in gathering information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention.
