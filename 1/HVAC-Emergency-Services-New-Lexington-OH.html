<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
