And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, location 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>Location the solar tank near the traditional hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. It is most likely that it is supported by the pipes if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
