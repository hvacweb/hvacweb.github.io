<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, steps ought to also be required to reduce contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.)

<p>The primary reason homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the quantity of services offered.
