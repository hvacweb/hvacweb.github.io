<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year.

<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties stay in place. Furthermore, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often hard to measure, as one action specified the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of repeated use of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature deterioration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.  an extremely beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
