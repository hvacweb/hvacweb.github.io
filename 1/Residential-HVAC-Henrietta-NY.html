While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, considering that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
