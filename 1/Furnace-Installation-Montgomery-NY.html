<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
