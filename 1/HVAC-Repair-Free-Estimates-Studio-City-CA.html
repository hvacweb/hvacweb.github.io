<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
