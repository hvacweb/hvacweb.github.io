<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
