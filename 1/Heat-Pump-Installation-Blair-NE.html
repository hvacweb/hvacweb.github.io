<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
