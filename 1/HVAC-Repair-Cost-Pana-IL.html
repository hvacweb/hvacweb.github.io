<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
