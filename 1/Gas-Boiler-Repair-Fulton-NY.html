<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the absence of appropriate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of impurities from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in more than half the office indoor air examinations it has carried out. Examinations performed in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually discovered the same to be true. These examinations revealed that proper ventilation is essential in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
