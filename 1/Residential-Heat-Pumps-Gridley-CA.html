<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
