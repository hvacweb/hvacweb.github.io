<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely pleased that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to check the a/c before you buy.

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
