<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Washington DC</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
