<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
