<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Hogansville GA Home</h3>
<p>Dunes Heating And Air Conditioning is HVAC Contractor offering the best possible Heating and Cooling Repair, maintenance and installation for your house or organisation in Mount Pleasant, Charleston and Isle of Palms South Carolina. You can count on us to supply you with a system and solution that fits your unique requirements and because we've installed many systems in this location, we have actually made a track record for doing the job right the very first time.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
