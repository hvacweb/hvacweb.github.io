<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is frosty. Likewise, if the a/c smells bad, there might be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat away from your home.
