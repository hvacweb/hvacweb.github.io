<p>Individuals working at Target aren't dumb or lazy and in this organisation all it takes is one tiny crack in your securities and somebody will discover it and pry you wide open, often in simply a few days.

<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. When the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and cure-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
