<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a referral in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
