<p>You could update to the greatest effectiveness gear readily available and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are only part of the central air conditioning system. The average home's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to choosing whether to repair or change your condenser and blower systems, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air leaves the system.<p>

<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years earlier and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
