<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, many of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item.

If it ends up being wet, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>
