<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years earlier and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, ceiling, floor, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold growth and should be discarded. Sometimes there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in covert or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances are there will be mold growing close by. Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
