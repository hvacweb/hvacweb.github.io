<p>Details supplied in this security guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the issues provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. The requirements do not need you to change your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services need to still be readily available for your home's systems.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future.
