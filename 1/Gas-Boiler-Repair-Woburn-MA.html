<p>First, unlike central air, you have a couple of choices when it concerns central heater. We'll jump into expenses later, however you can select from a heat, furnace or boiler  pump.

<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat circulation over the whole surface of a floor heats the lower half of the room, enveloping occupants in heat at a lower total temperature level-- sometimes up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heating unit." To put it simply, in-floor heating systems offer a different mode and level of comfort. And, as numerous public awareness campaigns have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we may be to push down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenditures.<p>
