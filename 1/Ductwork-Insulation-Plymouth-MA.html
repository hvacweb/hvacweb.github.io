<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently greater earnings for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or simply a high level of competition for knowledgeable trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest typical earnings for HVAC technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>

If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
