<p>The most typical type of house heater in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least pricey choice, however more recent systems can be really energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems normally accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, highly effective natural gas heating systems can achieve AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
