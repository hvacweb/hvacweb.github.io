<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized system.

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
