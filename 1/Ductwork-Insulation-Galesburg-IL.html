<p>Prior to you head out and purchase an air conditioning unit, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be installing the a/c unit? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How big should the ac system be? Too large and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can damage the ac system and shorten its life. Too little and your air conditioning system will not have the ability to cool your home effectively.

Each option can and will significantly impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to disregard any of them.<p>
<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from procedures or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
