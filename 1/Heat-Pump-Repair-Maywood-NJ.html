<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace too.
