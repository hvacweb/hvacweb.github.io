<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
