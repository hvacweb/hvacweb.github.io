However, pick your contractor carefully, many of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>This review is for replacing a 17 year old AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who described our choices did an excellent job in ensuring we comprehended the benefits and drawbacks of each option. The professionals who installed the brand-new system were fast and professional, while taking time to make sure we understood how the brand-new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>
