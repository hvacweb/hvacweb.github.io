<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
