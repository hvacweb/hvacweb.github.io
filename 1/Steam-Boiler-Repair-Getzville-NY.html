<p>Geothermal heatpump are very efficient, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a constant temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just obtain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter.
