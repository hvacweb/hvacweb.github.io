<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle.
