<p>I am a real estate investor, I require to replace two heating systems in a 8000square foot house. Some sources, such as building products, furnishings and items like air fresheners, can launch contaminants more or less continually. Other sources, associated to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, refurnishing or doing hobblies launch pollutants intermittently. Unvented or malfunctioning appliances or improperly utilized items can release higher and often hazardous levels of contaminants inside your home.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.

When radon becomes trapped in buildings and concentrations build up inside your home, exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>
