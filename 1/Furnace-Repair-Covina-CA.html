<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Make certain all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
