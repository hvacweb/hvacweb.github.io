<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
