<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the very same toxins. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>

<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your employer must inspect measurements of humidity, temperature level and air flow. In addition, inspection and screening of the ventilation, heating and cooling systems (to ensure it is working according to requirements for constructing usage and occupancy) need to be carried out. A structure walk-through to check for smells and try to find water damage, leakages, dirt or bug droppings may be valuable. Leaks need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofings and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with fungi or germs and need to be gotten rid of, also. In some situations, specific screening for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of structure tenancy. For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be inspected every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Risk Emergency Reaction Act-AHERA).<p>

<p>There is no simple response, however lots of utilize the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better service. If the existing system has actually not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and concerns that caused the breakdown can be identified and remedied, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been checked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
