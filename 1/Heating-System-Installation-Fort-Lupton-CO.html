<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern a/c) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner boost. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
