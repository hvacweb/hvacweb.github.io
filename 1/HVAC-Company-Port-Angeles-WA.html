<p>My oldest boy constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The noise level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
