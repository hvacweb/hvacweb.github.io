<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
