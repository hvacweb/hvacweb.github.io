<p>A/c can produce a great deal of water due to the fact that they remove moisture from the air. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
