<h3>Air Conditioning And Refrigeration in Avenal CA 93204</h3>
<p>We called Elite A/C on among the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to examine scenario & chose to choose them for the work. I more than happy to state that not just did we get the central air going however likewise changed the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke with from starting to end were really professional, considerate and the work was very effectively done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Use specialists and treat them well: Encouraged, well-compensated experts perform better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. Since they're low-cost, an ethical company doesn't make use of inexpensive labor opportunities just. Affordable workmanship is generally inferior workmanship, and it never ever assists a company construct long-term relationships with customers.<p>
<p>Your Evaluation This is my third time using Around the Clock. Ilan always makes himself available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is experienced with these gadgets). I have nothing but excellent things to state - he has taken good care of my heating and AC needs. Quick response - fast resolution.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
