<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
