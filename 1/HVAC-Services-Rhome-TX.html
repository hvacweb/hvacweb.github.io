<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a referral later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
