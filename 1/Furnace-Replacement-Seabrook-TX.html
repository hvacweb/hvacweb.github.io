Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Seabrook TX</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and final flooring finish. This is usually used in a third-floor or 2nd location and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
