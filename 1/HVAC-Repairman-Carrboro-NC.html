<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Carrboro NC</h3>

Used in addition to other types of heating or cooling, such as portable or window ac system, space heaters, or oil heating units, it can boost the convenience of your house while keeping your regular monthly energy bill sensible.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
