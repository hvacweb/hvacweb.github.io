<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>My eldest son constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items present a danger only when they are handled in a way that produces dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or disrupted by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can end up being airborne if correct controls are not in place. This can result in the capacity for considerable illness.<p>
