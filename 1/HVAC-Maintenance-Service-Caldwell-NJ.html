<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly harden and treat-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
