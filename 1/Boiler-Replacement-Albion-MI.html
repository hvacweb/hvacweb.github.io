<p>Increasing energy costs are not the only reason for high bills. Heaters often lose their performance as they age, specifically if they have not been effectively preserved. As a result your oil or natural gas furnace might run longer to supply the exact same quantity of heat. This will cause your energy expenses to go up. And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies monthly might be used to help you pay for a brand-new, much more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating bills with heating costs from the previous years. It's time to change your furnace if there is a significant distinction.<p>

<p>This is my 3rd time using Around the Clock.

I have absolutely nothing but great things to say - he has taken good care of my heating and AC needs. Quick reaction - quick resolution.<p>
<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
