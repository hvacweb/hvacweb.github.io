<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
