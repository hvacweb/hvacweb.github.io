<p>Enhance your services, make more services revenue, and offer a fantastic consumer experience. To make certain the system you choose is the ideal size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation price quote to identify the precise kind of heat and air conditioning system that's just right for your home-we don't simply replace it with the very same size unit you presently have. These computations take into account things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is necessary so the unit isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Photo 6).<p>
