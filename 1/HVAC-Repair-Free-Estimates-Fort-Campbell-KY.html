<h3>The Way to Choose An HVAC Company at Fort Campbell KY</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
