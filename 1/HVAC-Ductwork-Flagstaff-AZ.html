<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
