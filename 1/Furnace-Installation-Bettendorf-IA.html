<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
