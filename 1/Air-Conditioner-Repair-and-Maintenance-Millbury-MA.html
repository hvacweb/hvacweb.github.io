<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from procedures or products; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Sometimes a temporary indoor air quality issue is developed just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complex issues-- identified by regularly undesirable air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack. Depending on the problem you're experiencing, among the 3 tactics below might be proper.<p>
