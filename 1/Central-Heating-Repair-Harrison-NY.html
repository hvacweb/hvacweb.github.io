<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might observe musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues.
