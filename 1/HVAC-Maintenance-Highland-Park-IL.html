A/c help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in extremely humid climates or in cases where the a/c is extra-large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
