<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
