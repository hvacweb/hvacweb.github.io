<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for years.

<p>As noted, improper temperature and humidity levels, and too little or too much air circulation might likewise contribute to worker health grievances. Temperature level levels must vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air flow should be avoided. Maintenance of proper temperature levels and humidity levels and appropriate air circulation will help to lower the occurrence of upper breathing signs, and, potentially, skin rashes.<p>
<p>Before you head out and buy an a/c, there are a few things to choose initially. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning system? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How large should the ac system be? Too large and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the ac system and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioner will not be able to cool the house properly. These are just a few of the factors that you need to consider when shopping for a new AC system. Each choice can and will substantially impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to ignore any of them.<p>
<p>Normally the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to remove private sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later in this area.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers count on the outdoors air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be allowed to press the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to understand and maintain.<p>
