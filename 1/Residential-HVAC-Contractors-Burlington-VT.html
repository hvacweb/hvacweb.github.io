<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we advise using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of enabling heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Finally, if you do identify a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heater and choose to install it in your home, you might be qualified for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor expenses. (And these costs can be considerable. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, homeowners can expect to pay in between $6 and $16 per square foot, not consisting of tax and labor, for a radiant heat system.) Consult the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy (DSIRE) to see if there are refunds, loans or tax deductions readily available for the installation of a more effective in-floor heating system where you live.<p>
