<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable impact on occupants-- outside air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
