<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
