Gas furnace not blowing hot air? Simply as with switches, somebody may have turned off a gas valve and after that forgotten to turn it back on. Trace the gas line back from the furnace to the meter, and if you see a handle that's perpendicular to the gas pipe, turn it so it's parallel. Gas furnace repair is depends upon how old your furnace is. If you have an old furnace or boiler, you may have a pilot burner.
