<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
