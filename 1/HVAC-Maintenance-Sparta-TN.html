<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
