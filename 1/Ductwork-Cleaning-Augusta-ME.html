<h3>The Way to Maintain Healthy Ductwork To Get A Healthy Home in Augusta ME</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are exceptionally effective, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a consistent temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every system of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, around 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
