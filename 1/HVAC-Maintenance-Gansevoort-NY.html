<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
