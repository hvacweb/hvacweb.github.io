<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Somerset PA 15501</h3>
<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in delay features when they're closed down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
