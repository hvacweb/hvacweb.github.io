<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at Middlebury IN</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was needed and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the specialists thought they just didn't appear ideal and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
