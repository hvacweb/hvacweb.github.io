<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming indoors. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house.

Local restroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors remove impurities straight from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
