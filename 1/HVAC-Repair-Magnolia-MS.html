<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating devices can last for many years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel expenses unexpectedly appear greater than typical, it is probably time to think about a new system.

<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heat pump, whatever needs to be replaced eventually. As devices ages, it ends up being less efficient.

<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
