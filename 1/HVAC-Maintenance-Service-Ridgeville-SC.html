<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the appropriate temperature. Heaters that kick on often might be because of an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>
