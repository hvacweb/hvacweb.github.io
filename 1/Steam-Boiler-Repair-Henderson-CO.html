Permeable products, ceiling, wall, and flooring coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold growth and should be discarded. In some cases there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can thrive in surprise or rarely accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding.

Repair the wetness problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
