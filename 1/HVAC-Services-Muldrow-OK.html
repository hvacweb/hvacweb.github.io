<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as a Vital Business in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% performance or better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective.

<p>Dometic's commercial grade roof air conditioners are performance-tested to overcome unusual or extreme road and weather conditions. Numerous basic systems break down after simply 4 hours of extreme vibration testing, while the Vigorous II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel top plate offers enduring strength while long copper lines lessen vibration and, for that reason, noise too. While being one of the most difficult a/c around, its 410A refrigerant is kinder to the environment. Robust, light-weight and capable of performing in any environment! It will not let you down.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the skills or tools necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still essential to have a professional technician examine the system regularly.<p>
