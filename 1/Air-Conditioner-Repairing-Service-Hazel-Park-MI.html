When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>If you have a big home, a home with high ceilings, a house with lots of windows or a house with inadequate insulation, heating your floorings instead of the air may not suffice to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed. Homeowners would be well recommended to perform a house energy audit to examine where improvements may be made to increase the efficiency of an existing HVAC system. These modifications could actually accumulate and perhaps lower your viewed requirement for in-floor heating.<p>
<p>Before cooling or installing any brand-new heating system in a home, it is required to re evaluate and decrease the energy load of the house. A more energy efficient house will not just lower the cost of a new system and energy expenses, but it will significantly improve the convenience of your home. Before we design and install any systems, we schedule a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these improvements. Fundamental improvements typically include adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can recommend a number of competent house Energy Star auditors and installation specialists. Please Contact Us for recommendations.<p>
