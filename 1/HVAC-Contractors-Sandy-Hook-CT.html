<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a reference later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
