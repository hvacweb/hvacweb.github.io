<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
