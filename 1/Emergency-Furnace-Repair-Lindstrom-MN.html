<p>Designed to improve producing process control in a printing plant, Provider's invention controlled not just temperature but likewise humidity Carrier utilized his knowledge of the heating of items with steam and reversed the process. Instead of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thus the amount of moisture in the air might be managed, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper measurements and ink positioning. Later on, Provider's innovation was applied to increase productivity in the work environment, and The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America was formed to meet rising demand. With time, a/c came to be used to improve convenience in cars and homes as well.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a reference in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
