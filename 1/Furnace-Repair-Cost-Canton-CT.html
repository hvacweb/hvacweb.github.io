<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
