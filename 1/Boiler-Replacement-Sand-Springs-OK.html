All 5 other companies estimated me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is sincere, reputable, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
