<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power should not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the estimation of the total power is not basic, given that it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
