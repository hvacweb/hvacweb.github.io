<p>. Before picking the installation place of a/c, several primary aspects require to be thought about. Firstly, the instructions of air flow from the indoor units ought to not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there ought to not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that may prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outside unit should likewise be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be efficiently released outdoors and the performance of the whole system will drop dramatically.

ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or listed below 65%.
