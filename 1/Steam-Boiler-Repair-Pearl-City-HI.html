<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, schools and offices matters, especially since we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in extremely humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning system is large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system makers usually make rugged, high quality items. Start by examining any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails. Let the system cool down for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, situated in the compressor's access panel.<p>
