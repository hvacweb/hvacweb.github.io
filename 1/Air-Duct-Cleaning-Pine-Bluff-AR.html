<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the tools or abilities needed to check refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and correct airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the required equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
