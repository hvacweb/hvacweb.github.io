<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
