<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce toxins.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is used to carry the heat to the rooms. Many contemporary warm water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the circulation system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ).

The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
