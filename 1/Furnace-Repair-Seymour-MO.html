<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off contaminants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
