The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a referral later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
