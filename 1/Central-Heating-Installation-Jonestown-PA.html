<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.  Second of all like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the system has been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
