<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up.

<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Addison IL HVAC Company</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

Lower concentrations can cause a variety of signs from headaches, d izziness, weakness, disorientation, queasiness, and confusion, to fatigue in healthy people and episodes of increased chest discomfort in people with persistent cardiovascular disease. The signs of carbon monoxide gas poisoning are often confused with the flu or gastrointestinal disorder. Fetuses, infants, senior individuals, and people with anemia or with a history of heart or breathing disease can be especially sensitive to carbon monoxide gas exposures.<p>
