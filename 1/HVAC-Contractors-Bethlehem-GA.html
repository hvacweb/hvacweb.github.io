<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and individuals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
