<h3>Electric Heating System in Bristol CT 06010</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most budget-friendly if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
