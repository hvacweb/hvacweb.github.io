<h3>Gas Heating in Clairton PA 15025</h3>
<p>Central air units are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
