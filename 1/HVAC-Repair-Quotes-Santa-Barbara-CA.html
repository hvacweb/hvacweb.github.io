They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to purchase it. My better half stated that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good individuals I have satisfied in a very long time.
