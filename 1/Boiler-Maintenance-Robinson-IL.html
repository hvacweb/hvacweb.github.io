<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>

<p>The most harmful asbestos fibers are too little to be visible. After they are breathed in, they can remain and collect in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these diseases do not show up till many years after direct exposure began. Many people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to raised concentrations on the job; some industrialized illness from direct exposure to clothes and devices brought house from task sites.<p>
