<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Make certain all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
