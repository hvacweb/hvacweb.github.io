<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms.

However, much of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item.
