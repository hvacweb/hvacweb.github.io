<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
