<h3>Central Heating Boilers in Spring Hope North Carolina</h3>
<p>Making use of air filters can trap a few of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable resource section suggests that "Air Filtration need to have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to minimize the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can work as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can lower the performance of the coils.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
