It sounds amazing, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

Due to the fact that they do not need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because an unit is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
