It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>I am really amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour.

I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
