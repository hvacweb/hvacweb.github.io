<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
