<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
