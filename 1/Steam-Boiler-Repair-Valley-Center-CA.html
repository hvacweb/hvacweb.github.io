<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
