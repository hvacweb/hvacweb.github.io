Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00.

<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system.
