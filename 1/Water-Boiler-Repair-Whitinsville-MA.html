<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Whitinsville MA</h3>

These systems can obtain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect. The majority of ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for each unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
