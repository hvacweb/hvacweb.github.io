<h3>The Way to Choose An HVAC Company at Fowlerville MI</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely delighted that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the ac system before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
