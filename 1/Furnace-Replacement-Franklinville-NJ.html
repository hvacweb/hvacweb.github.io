<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Franklinville NJ</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
