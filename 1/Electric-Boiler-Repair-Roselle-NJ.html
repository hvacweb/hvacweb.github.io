<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. Connection problems along the line that supplies power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the unit. Loose, faulty or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of keeping your furnace involves checking the advised connections as well as temperature and pressure assesses. Require time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are protected and tight.<p>
<p>Location the solar storage tank near the standard hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil modification in your vehicle. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter as soon as every 3 months. During high use months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
