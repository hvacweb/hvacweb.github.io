<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
