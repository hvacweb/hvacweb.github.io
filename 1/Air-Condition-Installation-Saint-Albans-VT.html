If you do take our suggestion, expect to pay between $300 and $1,000 in labor expenses to install central air. In addition, cooling contractors may charge an extra $50 to $200 for additional products and devices.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
