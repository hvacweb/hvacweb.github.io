<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electrical power, gas or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish as much as 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
