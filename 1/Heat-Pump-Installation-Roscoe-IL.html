<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
