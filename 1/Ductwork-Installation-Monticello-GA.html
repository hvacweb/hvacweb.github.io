The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible.
