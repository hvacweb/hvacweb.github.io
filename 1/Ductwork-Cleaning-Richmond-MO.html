<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and connected them into a hot water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and an elementary pumping device to circulate warm water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the uniformity of the flooring heat transferred heat to other articles in the rooms, including the human residents.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heatpump, everything needs to be changed ultimately. As devices ages, it becomes less effective. Central air systems and heatpump typically last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last up to 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated lifespan, replacement may be the most economical solution.<p>

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature level, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on.
