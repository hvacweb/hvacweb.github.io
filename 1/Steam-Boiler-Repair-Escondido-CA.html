Thankfully, Denver and Littleton, CO area residents can count on Just Mechanical for all their AC repair requires for house cooling systems and commercial cooling systems.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they diagnosed the problem and fixed extremely rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy fasted to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced two furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the brand-new heaters can heat the house. Honestly, our house heater is made complex, Rob and his group fixed the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
