<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
