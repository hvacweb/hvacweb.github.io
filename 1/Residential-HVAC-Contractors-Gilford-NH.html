<p>Geothermal heating is among the most effective heating sources in terms of environmental expenses. Since the energy utilized to heat your home is drawn out directly from the ground, it protects the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or toxins. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems similar to those used in fridges. While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical energy, they release far less greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that require natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
