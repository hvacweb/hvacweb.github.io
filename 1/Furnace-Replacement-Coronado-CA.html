<p>As a skilled HVAC specialist, we advise you have your systems inspected and routine maintenance performed twice per year, when in the Spring (prior to cooling season) and once in the Fall (prior to heating season).

Keeping what is most likely the most important and expensive system in your home (cooling and heating) correctly kept will help keep your most significant financial investment of your life in great shape.<p>
<p>There is a required balance in making your choice though as systems with greater AFUE scores typically include higher price tags.

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature level of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>The installation was fast, professional and extremely well done. The installers were respectful and knew precisely what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and recognize easily people who are proficient at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are great and do not miss detail that creates a task extremely well done. I extremely extremely advise the 2 gentlemen as they are outstanding at what they do. Thank you to them as they definitely deserve my thanks and appreciation for a task well done.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold growth and must be disposed of. In some cases there is a moldy odor however mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in hidden or hardly ever accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials including carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the wetness problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>
