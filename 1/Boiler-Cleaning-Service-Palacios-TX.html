<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
