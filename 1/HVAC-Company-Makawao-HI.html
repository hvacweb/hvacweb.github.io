<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service in Makawao HI</h3>
<p>There are numerous reasons that this can happen. The bright side is that you can address many of these factors by yourself without the requirement to require expert aid. Start by opening the heat registers and after that move on to examining the thermostat settings. Next, check the furnace power, reset the furnace or examine the service door cover. You can likewise examine the filter to ensure it is clear of dirt and check the standing pilot light to ensure it is lit.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
