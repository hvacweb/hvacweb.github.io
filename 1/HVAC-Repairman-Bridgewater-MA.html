PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is normally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
