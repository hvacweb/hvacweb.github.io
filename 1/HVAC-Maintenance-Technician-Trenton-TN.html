<p>All heating unit have some level of air filtering. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some standard maintenance.

<p>My eldest child always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
