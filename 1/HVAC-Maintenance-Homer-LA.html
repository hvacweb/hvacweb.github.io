<p>When installing a wall sensor, think about the height at which they need to be put. A lot of commonly they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if people mainly remain seated in that particular location. However, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate towards the floor or ceiling; depending on what contaminant you're attempting to track you'll need to position the sensor accordingly. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the greatest concentrations inside buildings are usually near the ceiling.

<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
