Their techs are extremely well-informed and expert. Expenses are reasonable. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser this week.

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
