<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to purchase it. My other half stated that she had seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have fulfilled in a long time. We require to support the real people who are there for us if we want to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
