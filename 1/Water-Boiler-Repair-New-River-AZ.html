<p>Particular kinds of HVAC systems are a little more expensive than wall units, ceiling or cassette systems are nicely hidden inside the ceiling in the classroom and are therefore more discreet and aesthetically pleasing to look at. They offer powerful air flow and are substantially more effective than standard wall systems and can, therefore, lower the variety of units required and this can decrease installation and or replacement expenses where several HVAC units are needed. Ducted commercial-grade cooling systems are BETTER for the academic environment. They are normally the most costly option; however, they are also the most aesthetically pleasing as the duct-work and internal units hidden with minimal presence.<p>

He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total.
