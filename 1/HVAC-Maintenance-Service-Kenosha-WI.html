<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
