<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
