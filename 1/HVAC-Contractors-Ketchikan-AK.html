<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System since of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11.

<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't emit heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place with time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator requires managed by professionals, check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
