Likewise, tidy ducts and correct airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the necessary equipment for the task. The bottom line?

Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
