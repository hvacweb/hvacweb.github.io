<h3>HVAC repair services in Hudsonville MI 49426</h3>
<p>I have been using them for years for my companies, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is truthful, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to find a sincere AC guy and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
