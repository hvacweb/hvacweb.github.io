These convection heaters are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>More common in reasonably older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes oil, gas or electrical energy to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific rooms. All-electric boilers can attain approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers need to attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
