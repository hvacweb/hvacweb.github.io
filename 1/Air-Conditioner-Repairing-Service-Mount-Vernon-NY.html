<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was very thorough and on-time in explaining what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn provided great customer service at the end of the visit by describing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few recommendations of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have actually performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale methods utilized by some in the market.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Heavy production industries employ a fairly small portion of air conditioning service technicians and other HVAC employees, but pay a few of the market's greatest wages. Electrical power generating companies top the list, with a typical wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 annually. Automobile parts producers, aerospace manufacturers and vehicle makers are all within a couple of cents of each other at roughly $31 per hour, or over $64,000 per year. Trains are another high-wage company, at approximately $29.33 per hour or $61,000 annually.<p>
