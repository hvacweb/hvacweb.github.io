If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Do not position the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it since it exhausts warm air out the top. Any air flow restriction will lower the system's performance.

<p>The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon a number of aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important impacts.
