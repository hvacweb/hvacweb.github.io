The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the exact same duration. Basically, SEER supplies more information based upon how the EER performs in different temperatures. The greater the system's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>
