<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, instead of outdoor or commercial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It might likewise consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific spaces.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring equipment will send out the sensor data to the cloud, where you can access it through software application. You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results through a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>
