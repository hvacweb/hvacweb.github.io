<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, much of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<h3>Discontinue Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water in Colchester VT</h3>

Ventilation, a typical technique of minimizing exposure to indoor air pollutants, likewise will minimize but not eliminate direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Since smoking produces such big amounts of pollutants, natural or mechanical ventilation strategies do not remove them from the air in your home as quickly as they build up. In addition, the large boosts in ventilation it takes to substantially reduce direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs substantially. As a result, the most effective method to reduce exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to get rid of smoking there.<p>
