<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Extreme re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of workers in the area, stale air might also be a problem.<p>
