<p>Though it may be tough to think, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your home, but there are many other pollutants that can not only dirty up the air, but result in other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and building materials add to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers.

(And these costs can be significant. According to figures collected by Angie's List, house owners can expect to pay in between $6 and $16 per square foot, not including tax and labor, for a radiant heating system.)
