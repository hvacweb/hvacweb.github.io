Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
