<p>To be honest, few of the facilities supervisors who utilize our indoor air quality tracking service concerned us for that reason. More often than not they were at first thinking about from another location keeping an eye on some other aspect of their structures, such as energy use, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't until later, as they continued dealing with us, that they discovered and implemented indoor air quality keeping track of to provide a much healthier, much safer building environment-- and to head off the negative consequences connected with indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>A customized air conditioning unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A basic ac system transfers heat out of the room because its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the same amount of power.<p>
