<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
