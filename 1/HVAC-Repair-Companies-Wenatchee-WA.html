<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Some diseases, like humidifier fever, are related to direct exposure to contaminants from microorganisms that can grow in big building ventilation systems.
