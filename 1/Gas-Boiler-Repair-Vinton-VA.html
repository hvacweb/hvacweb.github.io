<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Vinton VA?</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math recently, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them..

As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the unit has been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
