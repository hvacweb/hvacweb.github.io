<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the proper temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly may be due to an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Pismo Beach CA</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of replacing or exchanging air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and extreme moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior building air circulating, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Lots of factors affect IAQ. These factors include poor ventilation (lack of outside air), problems controlling temperature, high or low humidity, current renovation, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air coming into the building. Sometimes, particular impurities like dust from building or restoration, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (including small amounts of chemicals released as a gas over time) may trigger bad IAQ.<p>
