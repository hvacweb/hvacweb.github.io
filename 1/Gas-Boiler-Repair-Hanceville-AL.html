<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square video footage. They utilize a series of computations based upon the British Thermal Systems or BTUs needed to heat the area. The larger the area, the more effective the house heating system requires to be. For currently constructed house heating unit, the contractor will require to eliminate the old furnace to add the brand-new one. These charges will be included in the installation costs.<p>
<p>The primary health impact related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
