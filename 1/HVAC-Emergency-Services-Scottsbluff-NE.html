<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating system does not generate its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, gas, or coal. Instead, it soaks up heat from within the earth. In addition, a geothermal heating and cooling system uses substantially less electrical energy compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heat pump. This makes a geothermal heating system an attractive service to cut your carbon footprint, offering a positive impact on the environment.<p>

They can lead to an unsafe build-up and jeopardize your safety if the exhaust outlets are obstructed.

They will look for signs of rust, leaks, and back draft and repair the problem throughout their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors.
