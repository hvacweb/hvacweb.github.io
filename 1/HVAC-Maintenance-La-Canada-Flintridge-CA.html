<h3>Heat Ventilation in La Canada Flintridge CA 91011</h3>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
