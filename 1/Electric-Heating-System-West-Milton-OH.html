<h3>Commercial Air Conditioner in West Milton OH 45383</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older system.<p>
