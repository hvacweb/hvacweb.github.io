<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide should be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
