<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Canton MS 39046</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
