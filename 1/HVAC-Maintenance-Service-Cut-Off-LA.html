<h3>AC Duct Repair in Cut Off Louisiana</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold.

The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
