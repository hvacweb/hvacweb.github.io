<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that ideal temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the roadway.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
