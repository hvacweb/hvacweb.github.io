<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>Home Furnace in Loganville GA 30052</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Due to the fact that it has restored my faith in great manufacturing, am delighted I got this however. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this brand-new Carrier I got because I purchased it 7 months ago. Itâ $ s simply best.<p>
