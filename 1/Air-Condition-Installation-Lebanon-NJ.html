(If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
