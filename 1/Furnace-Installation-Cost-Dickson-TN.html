<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heating systems were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the brand-new furnaces can heat the house. Truthfully, our house heating unit is made complex, Rob and his team repaired the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
