<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation expenses. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<p>As with most home improvement jobs, the cost of a complete central heating unit can vary extensively based on the size of the house. The majority of furnaces will last in between 15 and 20 years. In selecting a furnace, property owners need to think about heat output and performance. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A small home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and turn off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
