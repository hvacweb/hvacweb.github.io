<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

However, since all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
