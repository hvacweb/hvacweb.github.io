<h3>Heating Systems in Flatwoods KY 41139</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hours and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was really comprehensive and on-time in explaining what services would be carried out.

<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heating unit appears less like a luxury item and more like a need.
