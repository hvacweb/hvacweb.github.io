For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
