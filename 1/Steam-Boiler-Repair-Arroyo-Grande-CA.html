<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works at Arroyo Grande CA?</h3>
<p>Even newer heaters less than 5 years old have actually been discovered as bad. A lot of house owners are surprised to learn that their 'new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger. In many cases it is because of bad furnace style, but in many cases, it's from overlook. Paragon Heating & House Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Evaluation of your furnace includes a System Analysis, which checks for debris on the burners, poor air flow, and a filthy filter or blower, with cleaning and adjusting of the above as needed. The Efficiency Check-Up (see previous response above) is also essential to your furnace's life span.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
