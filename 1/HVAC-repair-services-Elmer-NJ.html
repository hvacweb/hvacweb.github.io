<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>When attempting to figure out how often I should replace my air conditioning filters, there are many things to take into factor to consider. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has a special DNA on how it collects dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your cooling filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right choice on how typically your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less frequently you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one cooling filter require changing regularly.<p>
