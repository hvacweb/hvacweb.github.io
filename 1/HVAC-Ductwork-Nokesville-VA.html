To make certain the unit you choose is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load computation price quote to determine the exact type of heat and cooling system that's ideal for your home-we do not just replace it with the exact same size system you currently have. These calculations take into account things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is essential so the unit isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be replaced ultimately. As devices ages, it becomes less effective. Central air conditioning systems and heatpump generally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last as much as 20 years.

A small home, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too rapidly and turn off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
