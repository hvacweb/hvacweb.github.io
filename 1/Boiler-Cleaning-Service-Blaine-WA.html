<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home will not heat up.

A dirty filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square footage.
