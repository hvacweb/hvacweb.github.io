<p>Last week, Target told press reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial invasion into its systems was traced back to network credentials that were stolen from a third party supplier.

As soon as the wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly solidify and treat-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
