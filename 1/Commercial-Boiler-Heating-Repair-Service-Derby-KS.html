<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Derby KS</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various home efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.)

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
