<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else might come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to purchase it. My better half stated that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent individuals I have actually met in a very long time. We require to support the real individuals who are there for us if we want to have options to ACME heating.

<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
