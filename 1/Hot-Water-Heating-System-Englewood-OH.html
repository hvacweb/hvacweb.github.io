<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at Englewood OH</h3>
<p>Most people are aware that outside air contamination can affect their health, however indoor air contamination can also have considerable, harmful impact. EPA studies of human exposure to air toxins suggest that indoor levels of contaminants might be 2 to five times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air pollution amongst the top five ecological health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
