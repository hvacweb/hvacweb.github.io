They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
