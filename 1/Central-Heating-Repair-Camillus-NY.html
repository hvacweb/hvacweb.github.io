<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the system has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
