<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage.

And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>

For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early wear and tear, resulting in cracks and holes. , if that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.. an extremely useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
