<h3>Heat Pump Installation in Chesterfield VA 23832</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really useful in collecting info on the phone and offering clear directions about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and offered clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
