<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be caused as the outcome of temperature extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and too little or excessive air flow. Workplace temperature levels should be maintained in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air circulation need to be avoided.<p>
<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being airborne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline irritant might bring on an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, however not in those individuals who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, but it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outdoors air needs to be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
