If your air conditioning unit is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Simply including refrigerant is not an option if it leaks.

The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the taken in heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
