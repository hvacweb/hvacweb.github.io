<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective if your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
