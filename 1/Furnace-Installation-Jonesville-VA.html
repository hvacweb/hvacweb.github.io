<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly lowers direct exposure to pollutants throughout cooking. Inappropriate modification, often indicated by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you buy a new gas range or variety, consider buying one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously. Never use a gas stove to heat your house. When the fireplace is in usage, always make particular the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>

<p>Only an expert can accurately diagnose why your furnace isn't starting. If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something seems strange or you lose confidence, it's time to call a professional.

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you discover you have to do it frequently, it's most likely time for a professional viewpoint.<p>
