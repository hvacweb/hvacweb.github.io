Load computing is referred to as the Handbook J computation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or system cost for a/c.

By comparison, examining and changing a furnace filter can typically be performed in just a couple of minutes, often with no tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
