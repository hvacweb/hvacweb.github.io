<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the quantity of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions should also be required to decrease contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, citizens need to be alert to the development of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization measures ought to not be undertaken until these problems have actually been remedied.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>

Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new heating systems can heat your house.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to offer enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
