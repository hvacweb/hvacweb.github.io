<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is wintry. Likewise, if the a/c smells bad, there might be germs accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat far from your home.
