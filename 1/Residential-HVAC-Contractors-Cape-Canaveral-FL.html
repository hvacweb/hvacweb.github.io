<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room.

As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
