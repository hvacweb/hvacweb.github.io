<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized.
