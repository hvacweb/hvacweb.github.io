One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are forced to withstand current, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a large retailer who asked not to be named because he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that consistently monitors energy usage and temperatures in shops to minimize costs (especially during the night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperatures in the stores vary beyond an acceptable range that might avoid customers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can pay for, a lot of Seattleites must find methods to combat the heat without a duct system.
