<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the very same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking devices will send out the sensing unit information to the cloud, where you can access it via software application. You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results through a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to analyze.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
