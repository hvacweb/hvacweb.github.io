<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators. This normally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies warmth from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
