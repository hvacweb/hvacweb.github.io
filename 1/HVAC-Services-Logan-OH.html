<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, though, there will constantly be the odd issue that sometimes shows up. It is extremely essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible when you do observe your furnace acting oddly.

<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be quickly incorporated with existing systems such as conventional forced air or glowing floor heating or can be installed in a new building. Required air systems will need a water-to-air heatpump while hydronic radiant heat systems will need water-to-water heatpump. The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop required depends on the heating & cooling requirements for your house and is important iin making sure the performance and efficiency of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is measured in lots. Typically, a 3-ton setup needs to be adequate for the average house, but home size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land schedule are all aspects which will affect the proper size for your particular home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you correctly size a system.<p>
