Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>The EPA recommends that you have your air ducts examined by a professional heating and cooling contractor.

<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with two local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and practical, Ballard Gas gave us a better deal, for extraordinary service. Instead of a simple sales job, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heater and situated ways we could have more even heat. He included these considerable but minor modifications in his bid. We chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump because of current warmer summertimes and for environmental reasons.<p>
<p>First of all, The after hours answering service agent, John, was expert and extremely polite. Second Of All, Gracion W is a prompt, experienced technician. He was at my home within the time he offered me, repaired the problem while describing the problem then remained numerous minutes to make sure it was working correctly. The concern was fixed in a matter of time that I've never ever seen prior to while being a property owner for ten years. I also recommend one of the Protection Plans, which I belong to, if you like to conserve cash. Thank you." Karen P.<p>
