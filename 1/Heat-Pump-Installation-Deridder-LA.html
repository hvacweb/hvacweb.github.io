<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heater, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
