<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
