<h3>Boiler Cleaning Service in Dunedin Florida</h3>
<p>Heating systems are home appliances whose purpose is to create heat (i.e. warmth) for the building.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
