While weatherization is underway, however, steps need to also be required to decrease pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, residents should look out to the introduction of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization procedures ought to not be carried out up until these problems have actually been corrected.<p>
<p>When you invest in a brand-new heating & cooling system, you're purchasing your house, your household, and your organisation.
