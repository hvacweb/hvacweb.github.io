<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs in between $300 to $500 typically. It's the ductwork that delivers cold air to each space in your home, and if it develops cracks which leak, they need to be repaired. Having faulty ductwork makes your system work harder with even worse results. Your home will not be properly cooled, and your energy expenses will go up. Installing brand-new ductwork for the entire house will cost approximately between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
<p>Typically the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
