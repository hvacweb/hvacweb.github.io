<p>Another approach to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside. The majority of home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window a/c with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate contaminants directly from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
