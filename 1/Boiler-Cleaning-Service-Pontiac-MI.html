<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might affect the health of people who live in the home. Contaminants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into the house from the ground below. An air pollutant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Viruses and germs, pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
