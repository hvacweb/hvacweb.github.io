<h3>AC Compressor Repair in New Hyde Park New York</h3>
<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>When setting up the whole system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Installing one included excavation, running numerous backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is quite expensive. Setting up a brand-new geothermal heat pump to work with an existing ground loop is far cheaper.<p>
