<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
