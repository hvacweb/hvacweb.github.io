<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively cure and solidify-- usually two to 4 weeks.
