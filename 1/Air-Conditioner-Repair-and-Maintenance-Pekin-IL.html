Today's furnaces are ranked 90% performance or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which might be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can suggest substantial cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall.

Ductless heatpump are fantastic for additions since they don't need any new ductwork to be installed. Since a system is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
