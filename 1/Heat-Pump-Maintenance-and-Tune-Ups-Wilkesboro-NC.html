<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>As much of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties stay in location. Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often tough to quantify, as one response stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system do not just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of recurring use of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to cracks and holes. , if that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.. a really advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
