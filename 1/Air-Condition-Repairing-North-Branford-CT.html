<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide need to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements.
