Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and excessive moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior building air circulating, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
