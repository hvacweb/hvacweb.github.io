<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
