According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and a/c company.
