If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is far from the house and return when the person returns, an effort needs to be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts may be intensified by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the cooling, heating, or humidity conditions prevalent in the house.<p>

<p>We advise using our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. When used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a really efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to warm up the concrete slab listed below.
