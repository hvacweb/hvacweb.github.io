For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, causing fractures and holes. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.  a really advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
