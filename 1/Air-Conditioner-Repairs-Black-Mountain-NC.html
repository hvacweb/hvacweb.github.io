<p>Instant discount rates on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are available to devices installers, used at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Service! Climate Pro is reputable and really cared about us and our situation. We came home one night to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that same night. Although he didn't have actually the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might search for and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely grateful to have a heated house again. What's most amazing was that this all taken place during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to assist us right before a vacation, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly recommend this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
