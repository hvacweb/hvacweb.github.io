<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
