<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an option for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, given that the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally just available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity.
