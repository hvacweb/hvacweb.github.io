<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Ridgecrest CA</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few reasonable ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex effectively advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up group was considerate of my home and installed the devices in the expected quantity of time. post install inspection outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
