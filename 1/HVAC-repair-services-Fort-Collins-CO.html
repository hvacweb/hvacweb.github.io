<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Fort Collins CO</h3>
<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that deals with indoor air quality issues. In the absence of such legislation, the "basic task stipulation" uses. This clause, typical to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, states that an employer must provide a healthy and safe office. Therefore, ensuring the air is of excellent quality is the employer's responsibility.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
