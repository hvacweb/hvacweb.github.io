<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
