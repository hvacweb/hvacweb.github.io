<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and effectively, however to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work started.

<p>Geothermal heat pumps are very effective, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a continuous temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling impact. The majority of ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every single system of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 units are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
