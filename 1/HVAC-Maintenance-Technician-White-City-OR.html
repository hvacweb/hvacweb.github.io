<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>

<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Usually the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later in this area.<p>
