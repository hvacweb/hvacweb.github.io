<p>Asthmatic kids are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might cause countless nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke triggers nose, throat, and eye inflammation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually connected exposure to secondhand smoke with the beginning of chest pain.
