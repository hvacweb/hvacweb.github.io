<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most typical heater in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for performance. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%.

The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- right away, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).
