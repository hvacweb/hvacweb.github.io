<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. If your air conditioning unit is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Just including refrigerant is not a service if it leakages. A skilled technician needs to repair any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the correct amount of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and performance of your a/c unit is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the manufacturer's requirements, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged.

<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Since as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in performance advantage. Since they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Because a system is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
