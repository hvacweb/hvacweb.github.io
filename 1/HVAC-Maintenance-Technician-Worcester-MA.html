Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling impact.
