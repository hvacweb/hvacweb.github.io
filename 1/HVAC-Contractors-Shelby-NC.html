Heat pumps work on electricity and work like air conditioning system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating unit (like a space heating system) with the exact same quantity of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
