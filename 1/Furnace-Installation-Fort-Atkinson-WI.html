A multi-split system 56 is a standard split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
