If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square video alone, move to another contractor. As with measuring the size of a system required based upon BTUs, identifying the appropriate size of unit for your home also depends on the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

Central air conditioning systems and heatpump usually last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last approximately 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life-span, replacement may be the most economical solution.<p>
