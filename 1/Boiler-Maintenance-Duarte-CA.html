The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
