<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
