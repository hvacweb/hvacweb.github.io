The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
