I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
