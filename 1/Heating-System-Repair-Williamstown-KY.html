<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that ideal temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the road. So, make certain to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which normally includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
