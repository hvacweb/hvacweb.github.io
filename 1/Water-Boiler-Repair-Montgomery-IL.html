<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Start-up," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan does not. Turn off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<h3>Things to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Montgomery IL</h3>
<p>I have been using Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have actually kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are professional and really experienced. Costs are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser this week. Since the cost was certainly affordable, I did not bother to get rival's quotes because of my rely on Waychoff.<p>
<p>I have actually become reasonably proficient at investigating products on line prior to acquiring them. However I don't find that there is a central place for searching details about the "real" worth of house HVAC systems or maybe I must state a sincere assessment of these products. Given that I live in FL it is critical to have an excellent AC unit in your home since they are actually taxed in the summer season.<p>
