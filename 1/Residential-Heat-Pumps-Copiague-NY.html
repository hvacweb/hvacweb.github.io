<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s below package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, consisting of individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that sudden shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>
