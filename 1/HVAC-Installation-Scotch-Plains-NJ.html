<p>A specific air conditioning system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air course. A basic ac system transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, because all components of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is actually heated, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same amount of power.<p>

People at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
