First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, consider utilizing strong wood products. Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make certain that an efficient wetness barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it ends up being damp.<p>
