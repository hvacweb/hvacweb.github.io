Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make certain that an efficient wetness barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it ends up being damp.<p>
