<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and last flooring surface. This is generally used in a 2nd or third-floor  area and takes advantage of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>

The energy effectiveness of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
