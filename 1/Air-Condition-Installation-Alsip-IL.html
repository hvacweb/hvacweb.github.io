<p>Improve your services, earn more services revenue, and offer an incredible client experience. To make sure the unit you select is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load estimation estimate to identify the exact type of heat and air conditioning system that's just right for your home-we don't just change it with the very same size system you currently have. These estimations consider things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is necessary so the unit isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>

<h3>AC Unit Repair in Alsip Illinois</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the check out. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was very happy they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>
