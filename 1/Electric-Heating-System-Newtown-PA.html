<p>There are numerous actions a homeowner can take to choose items that will prevent indoor air problems from taking place - a couple of them are mentioned here. First, use exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, consider using strong wood items. Second of all, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make certain that a reliable wetness barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. If it becomes wet, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of.<p>
