<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in the house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>

<h3>Clogged Air Filters in Lebanon KY 40033</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
