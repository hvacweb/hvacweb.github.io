<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems.

However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
