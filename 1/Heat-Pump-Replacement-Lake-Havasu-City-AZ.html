<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
