<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Menominee MI Home</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here).

<p>Do not stress! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it just may require 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat requires 24 volts of low voltage supplied by your transformer to keep the digital screen on. You'll get a blank screen if 24 volts isn't acquired. There are many different reasons your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be talking about why you might be having difficulty with your Nest wise thermostat. Check your emergency breakers first. You need to have the right amount of high voltage going to your furnace. If you have the proper 120 volts of power going to the furnace, inspect.

There are many wires in your furnace.<p>
