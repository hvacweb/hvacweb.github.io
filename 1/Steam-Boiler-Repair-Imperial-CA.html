<p>The first air conditioning unit and refrigerators employed combustible or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<h3>Picking the Right Imperial CA Company For Heating Repair</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants released by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside your home might trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of co2 in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
