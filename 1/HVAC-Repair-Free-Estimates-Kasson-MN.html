<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
