<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
