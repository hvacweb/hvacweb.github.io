<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements.
