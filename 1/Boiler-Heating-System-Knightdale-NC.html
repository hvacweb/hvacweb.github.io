<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
