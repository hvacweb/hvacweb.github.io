<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives typically amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with standard equipment.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton.

<h3>Assessing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers in Sheboygan Falls WI</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
