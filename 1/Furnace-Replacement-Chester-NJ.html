<p>One of the downsides of central heating is that it's potentially costly to set up, especially in an older home. Depending upon the kind of system installed, it can be loud and trigger issues if you're highly allergic to dust.

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, many of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
