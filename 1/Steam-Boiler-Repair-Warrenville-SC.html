<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s below package to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
