<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly decreases direct exposure to pollutants throughout cooking. Improper change, frequently suggested by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you purchase a new gas stove or range, think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously. Never use a gas range to heat your home. Always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>
