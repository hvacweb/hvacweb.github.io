<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
