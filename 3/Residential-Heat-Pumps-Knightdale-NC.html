<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold may be living in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and air conditioning system. There are numerous style approaches in use today; nevertheless, all ground source heat pumps operate with comparable concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface area units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth.

Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions since they do not require any new ductwork to be installed. Because a system is installed in each room or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
