<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively simple procedure. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite costly if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing material bought with the house. This company presented a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing.
