<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
