There are several style techniques in use today; however, all ground source heat pumps run with similar principles. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>Radiant heat provides a number of distinct benefits over forced air heating systems. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy effective than forced air systems.

A house heated by a glowing system will warm up much faster, and remain warm with less energy spent. These are just a few of the numerous benefits that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>
