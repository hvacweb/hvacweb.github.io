Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all elements of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat is gotten rid of.

<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.
