<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Chicago Heights IL Home</h3>
<p>In the last several years, a growing body of scientific proof has actually indicated that the air within homes and other structures can be more seriously contaminated than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Other research suggests that individuals invest around 90 percent of their time inside your home. Thus, for many individuals, the dangers to health may be higher due to exposure to air contamination inside than outdoors.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature level, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
