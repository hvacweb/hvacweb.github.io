<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
