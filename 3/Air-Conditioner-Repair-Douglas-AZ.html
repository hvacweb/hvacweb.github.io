<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to keep an eye out for is the dust that gathers throughout summer seasons. The very best thing to do is ensuring that the heater burners are examined and cleaned up completely before colder seasons begin.

<h3>Floor Heating System in Douglas Arizona</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 major elements fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Most people do not understand that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break with time. That can jeopardize the efficiency of the system and ultimately harm it enough that you require to invest in furnace replacement or AC replacement. The maintenance technician will carefully analyze the connections and evaluate the performance of the system. They'll try to find torn and damaged wires and replace them in order to lessen the risk of fire and part failure.<p>
