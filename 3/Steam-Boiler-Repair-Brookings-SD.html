<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, however a homeowner does not have the skills or tools needed to check refrigerant levels.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still needed to have an expert technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can pay for, so many Seattleites should find ways to combat the heat without a duct system.
