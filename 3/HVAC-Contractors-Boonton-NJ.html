<p>As much of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment maker's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in location. In addition, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often difficult to quantify, as one action specified the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the outcome of repeated use of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature deterioration, resulting in fractures and holes. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.  a very helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
