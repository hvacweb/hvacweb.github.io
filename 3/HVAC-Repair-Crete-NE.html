HVAC specialists suggest following this basic guideline when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new.

If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly straightforward procedure. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>
