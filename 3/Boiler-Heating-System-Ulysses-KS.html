<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
