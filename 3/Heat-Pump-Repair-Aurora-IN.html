They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to buy it. My wife stated that she had actually seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have actually fulfilled in a long time.
