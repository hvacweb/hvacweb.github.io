<p>Variable speed is the method to go if it's time to update an aging AC. Currently planning to replace an existing a/c unit? Assuming your budget accommodates a variable speed system, you should definitely get one! You'll feel more comfortable throughout the summer season, and your indoor air will be lot cleaner.

<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as a really efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of permitting heat to heat up the concrete slab listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
