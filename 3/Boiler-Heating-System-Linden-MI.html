<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are quickly breathed in. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat irritant might cause an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
