<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
