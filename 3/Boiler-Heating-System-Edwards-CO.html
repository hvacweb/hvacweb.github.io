The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control panel need to be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
