<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Lecanto FL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Use or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common technique of minimizing exposure to indoor air contaminants, also will reduce but not remove direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Because cigarette smoking produces such big quantities of contaminants, natural or mechanical ventilation techniques do not eliminate them from the air in your house as quickly as they build up. In addition, the large increases in ventilation it takes to considerably lower direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs significantly. As a result, the most reliable way to decrease direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to remove smoking there.<p>
