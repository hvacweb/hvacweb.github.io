<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Holden MA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>In the last a number of years, a growing body of clinical proof has actually indicated that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outside air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research suggests that individuals invest around 90 percent of their time inside. Thus, for many individuals, the threats to health might be greater due to exposure to air contamination inside your home than outdoors.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
