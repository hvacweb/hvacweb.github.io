A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run since it just takes more electrical power to run a larger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
