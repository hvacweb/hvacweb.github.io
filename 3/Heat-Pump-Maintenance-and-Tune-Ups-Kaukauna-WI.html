Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling.

<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
