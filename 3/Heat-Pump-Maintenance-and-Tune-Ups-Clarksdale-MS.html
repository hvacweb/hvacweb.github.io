<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold accumulation, states Dr. Khatri.

<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and effectiveness if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can fail in the exceptionally hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
