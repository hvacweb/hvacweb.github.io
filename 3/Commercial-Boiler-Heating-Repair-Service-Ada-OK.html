<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Ada OK</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various house efficiency upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's products and services was excellent. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the required electrical enhancements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>First, understand that a bulk of your central air and unit cost will originate from the unit itself. AC unit costs start at $2,000 and can actually surpass $10,000 for bigger homes. As you saw just recently, you need an appropriately-sized unit for your home. Otherwise, the AC will break down quicker than anticipated or your monthly energy expenses will escalate. For that reason, you don't have overall control as to your AC unit product costs.<p>
