<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, a number of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least when a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that frequently, our nationally representative survey discovered. Roughly 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
