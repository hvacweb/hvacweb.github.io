<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>While contaminants commonly found in indoor air are accountable for many damaging effects, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are necessary to produce particular health problems. Individuals also respond very in a different way to direct exposure to indoor air toxins. Additional research is needed to better comprehend which health impacts occur after exposure to the average pollutant concentrations found in houses and which happen from the greater concentrations that happen for short periods of time.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
