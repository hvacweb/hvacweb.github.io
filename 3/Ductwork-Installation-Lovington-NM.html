My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>I highly suggest utilizing this service. Very dependable exceptionally nice. Looked after a part that was not covered under service warranty quickly and effective and did not need to pay a leg and an arm to get it done.
