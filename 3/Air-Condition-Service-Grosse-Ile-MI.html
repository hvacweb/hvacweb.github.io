<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a company was for financial flexibility.
