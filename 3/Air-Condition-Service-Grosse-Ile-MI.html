<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a company was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners should pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
