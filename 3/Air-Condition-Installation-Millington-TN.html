<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold may be living in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. However a number of the important things people do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their homes and intensify asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The ability of natural chemicals to trigger health results varies considerably, from those that are highly poisonous, to those without any recognized health result. Just like other toxins, the extent and nature of the health result will depend upon numerous factors including level of direct exposure and length of time exposed. Eye and breathing system irritation, headaches, lightheadedness, visual conditions, and memory disability are among the instant signs that some individuals have experienced not long after direct exposure to some organics. At present, very little is known about what health impacts happen from the levels of organics typically discovered in houses. Many natural compounds are understood to trigger cancer in animals; some are suspected of causing, or are known to trigger, cancer in humans.<p>

<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the greater temperatures often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions.
