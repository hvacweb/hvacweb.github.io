<p>I am an investor, I need to replace 2 heaters in a 8000square foot house.

Unvented or malfunctioning devices or poorly utilized products can release higher and in some cases unsafe levels of pollutants inside.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single go to, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year.
