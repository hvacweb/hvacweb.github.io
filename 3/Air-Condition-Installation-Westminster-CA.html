<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil.
