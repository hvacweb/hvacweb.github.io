<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that sudden shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>

<p>Central air units are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very helpful in collecting info on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
