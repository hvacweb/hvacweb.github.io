<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price great however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
