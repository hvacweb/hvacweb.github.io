Many common building products utilized prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Typically, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling. Since the fibers can be spread into the air during the removal procedure, elimination of asbestos-containing materials is not constantly ideal. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often recommended instead.<p>

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
