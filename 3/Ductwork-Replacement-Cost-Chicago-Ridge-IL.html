<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually viewed the single-family house installation service totally turn on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not simply with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle house owners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
