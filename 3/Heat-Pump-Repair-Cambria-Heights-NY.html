<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is wintry. Also, if the air conditioning system smells bad, there could be germs accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your home.

Here's why purchasing the best size air conditioning system matters: if you purchase an HVAC system that's too big, you'll end up losing money and energy. And if it's too little, you won't get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfortable.<p>

A professional technician will check the thermostat during the annual maintenance to make sure the real temperature level and the temperature level on the thermostat matches. If there's a difference in the temperature level, the technician requires to inspect the thermostat's performance or evaluate the whole HVAC system.<p>
