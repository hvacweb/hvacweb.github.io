<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in North Hollywood CA 91605</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and sensible on cost. It's hard to find an honest AC person and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Your Evaluation This is my third time utilizing All the time. Ilan always makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is knowledgeable with these devices). I have absolutely nothing however fantastic things to say - he has actually taken good care of my heating and AC requirements. Quick action - quick resolution.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time repairing the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
