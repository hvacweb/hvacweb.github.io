<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Lancaster TX</h3>
<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you hire to install your central air conditioning system. In reality, you can even Do It Yourself, regardless of our strong suggestion not to do so. If you do take our recommendation, anticipate to pay in between $300 and $1,000 in labor costs to install central air. In addition, cooling contractors might charge an additional $50 to $200 for extra materials and devices.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
