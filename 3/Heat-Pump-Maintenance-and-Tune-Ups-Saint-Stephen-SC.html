<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>If you work in building, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your hobby involves lead, you may unconsciously bring lead into your house on your hands or clothes.

Soil by highways and roadways might be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks and trucks that utilized leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet before entering the home. If you deal with lead in your task or a pastime, change your clothes prior to you go house and clean these clothing separately. Encourage your kids to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which stays with fingers and toys. Try to keep your kids from consuming dirt, and ensure they clean their hands when they come inside.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>As a building owner or facility supervisor, you need to consider the cost of unforeseen downtime and the impact older, inefficient systems have on the bottom line.
