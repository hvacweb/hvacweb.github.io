<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
