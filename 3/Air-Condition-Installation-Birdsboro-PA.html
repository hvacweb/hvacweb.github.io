<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most affordable. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a distribution system. Metal pipelines are rarely used due to long-lasting corrosive concerns. Essentially all hydronic glowing flooring heat systems today utilize 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is extremely flexible, won't rust and is available in long lengths, which enable PEX pipeline to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
