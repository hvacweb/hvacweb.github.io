<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
