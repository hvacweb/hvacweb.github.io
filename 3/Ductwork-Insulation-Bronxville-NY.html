<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
