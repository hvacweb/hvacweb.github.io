<p>In a lot of cases, if materials have stopped working to dry several days after the suspected water event, mold growth is presumed within wall cavities even if it is not right away noticeable.

<p>While pollutant levels from individual sources might not present a considerable health threat on their own, many homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a major threat from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that most people can take both to decrease the threat from existing sources and to avoid new issues from taking place.

<p>Next, and possibly just as crucial when it concerns central air costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, humans breathe out carbon dioxide, which in small quantities is not poisonous, but may become hazardous if high concentrations are permitted to build up. Bacteria or micro-organisms may likewise exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they might spread out throughout the entire work environment or building by methods of the ventilation system.<p>
