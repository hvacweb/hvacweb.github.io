<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Fort Valley GA</h3>
<p>Certain instant impacts resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is frequently challenging to identify if the symptoms are a result of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is very important to take note of the time and location signs happen. If the signs fade or go away when an individual is far from the location, for instance, an effort must be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects might be intensified by an inadequate supply of outside air coming inside or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions common inside your home.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
