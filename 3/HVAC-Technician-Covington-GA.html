Feel free to ask about our service plans that include preventive maintenance if you want to stay ahead of any problems with your house or business HVAC system, so you can avoid expensive repairs or replacements.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
