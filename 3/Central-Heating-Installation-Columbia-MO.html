<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones.

The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
