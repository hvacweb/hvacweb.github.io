<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
