<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
