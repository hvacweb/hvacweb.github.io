<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have 2 major components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty.

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it exhausts warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any airflow constraint will reduce the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>The most underrated HVAC component in your cooling system is the evaporator & condenser coil. When making a huge HVAC choice on changing your devices, the majority of individuals believe the compressor is the only part that matters.

When the copper or aluminum coils begin to rust, refrigerant leaks occur.<p>
