<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you must check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
