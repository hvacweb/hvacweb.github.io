Their techs are really well-informed and expert. Expenses are reasonable. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser today. I did not bother to get rival's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff since the cost was clearly affordable.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which requires to be appropriately vented and cleaned up from the furnace regularly.

Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
