(And these costs can be considerable. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, property owners can expect to pay between $6 and $16 per square foot, not including tax and labor, for a radiant heating system.)

<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is typically crucial to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such information can in some cases be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping an eye on data is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent must request that the company have air monitoring tests performed. Review of this data may recognize possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
