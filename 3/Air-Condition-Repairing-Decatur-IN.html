<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
