<h3>The Way to Get Rid of Boiler Problems in Grafton WI</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
