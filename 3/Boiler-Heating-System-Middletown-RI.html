<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
