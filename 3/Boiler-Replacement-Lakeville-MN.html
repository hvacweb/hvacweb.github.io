<h3>Furnace Installation in Lakeville Minnesota</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the visit. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
