<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>A SEER score means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same period. Basically, SEER provides more information based on how the EER carries out in various temps. The higher the unit's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>
