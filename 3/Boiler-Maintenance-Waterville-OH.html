<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor ecological quality") describes how inside air can affect a person's comfort, ability, and health to work.

<p>Air conditioners can produce a great deal of water because they remove moisture from the air. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work.

To deal with condensate problems, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 ought to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
