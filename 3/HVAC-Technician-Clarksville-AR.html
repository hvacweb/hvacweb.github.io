The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
