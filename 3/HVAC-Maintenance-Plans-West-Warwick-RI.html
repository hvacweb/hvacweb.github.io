<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in West Warwick RI?</h3>
<p>Sean was really practical. He is a very pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
