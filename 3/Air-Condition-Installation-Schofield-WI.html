<p>A matched system is the mix of items that comprise your HVAC system. Depending upon your region, a matched system can be composed of the following: an a/c unit and furnace, a heat pump and furnace, a heatpump and air handler, an air conditioning unit and air handler, or an all-in-one packaged" system. By integrating components that are made to work flawlessly together, you can develop a more effective ideal system.<p>

<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing material acquired with your house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing.
