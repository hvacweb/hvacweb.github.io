<p>Additionally, tidy and even vacuum constantly in the area where your heating system is located. Even though you might think that clearing the room of all items that may catch fire at some point provides adequate safety, in some cases other scrap such as lint and dust might gather inside the furnace which might trigger a fire. Too much lint and dust will also obstruct your filter quicker than it should be which will be a blow to your spending plan as you will need to replace the equipment or repair.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the tools or skills necessary to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the required equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still needed to have a professional technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the United States your house lies, the local region's environment can alter drastically. A home situated in the South would need an AC system with a size efficient in cooling your house due to heat Summers. A home in the Northern part of the US would need a much bigger heating capability also which will impact expenses. See the chart below for the typical central air conditioner replacement expenses by LOTS.<p>
