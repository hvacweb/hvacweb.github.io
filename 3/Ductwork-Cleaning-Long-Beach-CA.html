<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
