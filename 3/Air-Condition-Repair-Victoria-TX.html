<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
