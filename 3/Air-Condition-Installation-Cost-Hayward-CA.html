The crew took the whole day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We picked getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
