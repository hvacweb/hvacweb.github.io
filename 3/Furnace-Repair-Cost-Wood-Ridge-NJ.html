<p>There is no easy answer, but lots of utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better service.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
