<p>Learn More About PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air conditioning unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy effective than models made even 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to change or update your system if it's 5 years of ages or older. The very best central air conditioning conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one acquired in 1975 while providing the same amount of cooling.<p>

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of pollutant direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday.

Place control involves moving the pollutant source far from occupants or even relocating vulnerable residents.<p>
<p>A geothermal heater does not create its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, coal, or gas. Instead, it absorbs heat from within the earth.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
