<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building or remodelling of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants.

<p>Lastly, if you do identify a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heating system and choose to install it in your home, you could be eligible for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor costs.

Evaluation of this data might identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping track of information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
