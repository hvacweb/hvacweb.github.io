<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
