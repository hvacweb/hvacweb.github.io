<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Monterey Park California</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the check out. They suggested changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was really happy they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
