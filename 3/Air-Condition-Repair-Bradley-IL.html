<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
