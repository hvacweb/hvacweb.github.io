<p>Next, and maybe simply as crucial when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air.

Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
