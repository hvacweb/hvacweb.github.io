<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite.
