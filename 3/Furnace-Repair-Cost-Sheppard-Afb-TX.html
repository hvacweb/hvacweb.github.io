<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
