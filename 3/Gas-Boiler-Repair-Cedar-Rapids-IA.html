<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
