<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide should be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
