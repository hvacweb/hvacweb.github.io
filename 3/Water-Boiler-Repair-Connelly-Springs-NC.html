<p>Since an air conditioning unit moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are delicate to indoor irritants or have respiratory issues, winter season can worsen problems.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
