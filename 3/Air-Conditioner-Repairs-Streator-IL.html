<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
