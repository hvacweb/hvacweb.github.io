<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Needs in Laguna Woods CA</h3>
<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the a/c. I went on and purchased this Carrier and I must state it does the job quite well. It takes really little time to warm up or cool down the house which is among the important things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had before. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
