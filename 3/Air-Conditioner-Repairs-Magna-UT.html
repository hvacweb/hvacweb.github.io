<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Magna UT?</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in house construction is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in floors, roofing systems, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
<p>When installing a wall sensor, think about the height at which they need to be placed.

For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside buildings are normally near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is much heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>
