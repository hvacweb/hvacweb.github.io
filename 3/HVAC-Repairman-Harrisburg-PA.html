Whether you need an examination, repair, installation or maintenance for your HVAC system, you can rely on the specialists at AAA Heating & Cooling to finish the job right.<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay regularly higher earnings for air conditioning tradesmen. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or just a high level of competitors for competent trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest typical earnings for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 each year.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your house that best temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those typical air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the roadway. So, make certain to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service strategy which generally includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
