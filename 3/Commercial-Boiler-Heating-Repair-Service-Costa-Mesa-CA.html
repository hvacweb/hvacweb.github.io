They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to purchase it. My better half stated that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good individuals I have actually fulfilled in a long time. We need to support the real individuals who are there for us if we desire to have options to ACME heating.
