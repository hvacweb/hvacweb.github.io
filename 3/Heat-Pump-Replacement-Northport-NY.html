<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
