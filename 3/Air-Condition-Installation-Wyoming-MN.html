<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 ought to be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
