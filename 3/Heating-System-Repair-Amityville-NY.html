<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Building And Construction and Commissioning is designed for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other experts interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include building products, smoking cigarettes, family products, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating units.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
