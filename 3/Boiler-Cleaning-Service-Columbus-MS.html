<p>For instance, issues occur when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in adequate quantities of outside air. Inadequate ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or placed in such a way that outside air does not really reach the breathing zone of structure occupants. Poorly situated outside air consumption vents can also generate air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>

<p>Property owners may also assume that because a radiant floor heating system can be seen (and financed) as a home enhancement, its installation will immediately raise their home's value.

In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Worth Report provided by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Remodeling Magazine. Maybe Real estate agents must consider a lot of variables to definitively state what a radiant heating system might add to, or deduct from, any given asking rate. That stated, homebuyers looking to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heater will be willing to pay a premium for a home that includes one.<p>
