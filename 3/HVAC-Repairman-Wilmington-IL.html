HVAC specialists recommend following this standard rule when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>Radiant heating provides a number of distinct advantages over forced air heater. For example, radiant heating systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They do not have to worry about duct leaks, which are responsible for output losses of approximately 30% in other heating unit types. Sending heat through strong objects will likewise cause it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium.
