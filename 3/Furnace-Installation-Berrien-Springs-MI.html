<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're closed down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
