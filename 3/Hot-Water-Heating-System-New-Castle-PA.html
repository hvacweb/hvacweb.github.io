<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and area of toxin exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This permits items to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the staff are at house over the weekend. Place control involves moving the pollutant source far from occupants or even relocating susceptible occupants.<p>
<p>Some health impacts may appear quickly after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures to a toxin. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are treatable and normally short-term. Sometimes the treatment is simply getting rid of the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants, symptoms of some diseases such as asthma might appear, be aggravated or gotten worse.<p>
<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is allowed to rise and flow out high structure openings to the outdoors (stack impact ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings.

Air-side economizers likewise utilize outdoors air to condition spaces, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outdoor air when suitable.<p>
