<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
