<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that protect your a/c system from flooding. Among the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on uncommon occasions.<p>
