<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a recommendation later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
