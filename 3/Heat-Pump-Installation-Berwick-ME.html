<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
