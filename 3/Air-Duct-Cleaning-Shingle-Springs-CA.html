<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
