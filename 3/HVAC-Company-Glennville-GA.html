<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads.

Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
