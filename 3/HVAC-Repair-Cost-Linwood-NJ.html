(If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
