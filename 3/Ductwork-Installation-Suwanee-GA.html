That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
