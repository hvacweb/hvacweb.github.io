<p>Let's start by detailing the planning that needs to occur prior to you actually buy a furnace. Picking a furnace for your house isn't as basic as choosing one off a showroom floor. Not all heating systems are good for all homes, and there are a number of factors that absolutely need to be thought about before choosing one. Initially, you'll need one that is properly sized for your house. A furnace that is too large will put out excessive heat for your system to handle, and will trigger issues like short-cycling that can shorten its life.

There are regulations in France and in Germany, and many voluntary ecolabels and rating systems consisting of low VOC emissions requirements such as EMICODE, 19 M1, 20 Blue Angel 21 and Indoor Air Comfort 22 in Europe, along with California Standard CDPH Section 01350 23 and several others in the USA. These initiatives altered the marketplace where an increasing variety of low-emitting products has appeared throughout the last years.<p>
<p>Before cooling or setting up any new heating system in a home, it is required to re evaluate and reduce the energy load of the house. A more energy effective home will not just minimize the cost of a new system and utility expenses, but it will greatly improve the comfort of your home. Before we design and install any systems, we schedule a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Standard enhancements typically consist of adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can advise several certified house Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact Us for referrals.<p>
