<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts decades, given that it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical guidelines get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
