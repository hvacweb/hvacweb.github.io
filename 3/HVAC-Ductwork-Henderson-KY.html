<p>Specific types of HVAC systems are a bit more expensive than wall units, ceiling or cassette systems are nicely concealed inside the ceiling in the class and are therefore more discreet and aesthetically pleasing to look at. They provide effective air flow and are significantly more powerful than standard wall systems and can, therefore, minimize the number of units required and this can decrease installation and or replacement costs where multiple HVAC systems are needed.
