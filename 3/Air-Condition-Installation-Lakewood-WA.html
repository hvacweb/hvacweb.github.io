<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Lakewood WA</h3>
<p>Elements that can add to the development of biological contaminants are wet or damp structure products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and improperly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c unit. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease brought on by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Various fungi and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are animals and household plants.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Make sure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
