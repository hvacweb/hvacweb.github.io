<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Kids, fetuses, and babies are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults because lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Children may have greater exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
