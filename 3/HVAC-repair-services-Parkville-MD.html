<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the very first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial buildings, apartment and huge residences. Many steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago remain operable, since the absence of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to tear and wear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
