<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power ought to not surpass the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, since the total capability of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Simply put, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not easy, because it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>I'll start with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heater in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
