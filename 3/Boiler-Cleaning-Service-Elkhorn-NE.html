<p>Designed to improve producing procedure control in a printing plant, Carrier's innovation managed not only temperature level but also humidity Provider used his understanding of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process. Instead of sending out air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and consequently the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room manageable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped preserve constant paper measurements and ink alignment. Later on, Provider's innovation was used to increase performance in the workplace, and The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America was formed to fulfill rising demand. In time, air conditioning became utilized to improve convenience in cars and houses too.<p>
