<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
