Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<h3>Air And Heat Repair in Pacific MO 63069</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
