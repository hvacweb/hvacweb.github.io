<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Mobile homes are usually smaller sized than stick-built properties and use significantly less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat. Anticipate the average mobile house oil furnace to have starting costs of around $1,500. Remember that not as many brand names produce oil furnaces for this use, and you might discover more options with natural gas, lp, or electric heaters.<p>
