<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
