<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
