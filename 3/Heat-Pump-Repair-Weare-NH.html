<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, considering that it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>

Prior to inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
