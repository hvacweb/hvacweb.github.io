<p>Many individuals undervalue the level of the indoor air contamination issue. Air contamination is typically visualized as the black smoke released from factories.

Heat pumps transfer heat from outside the structure into the air within. Initially, heat pump HVAC systems were only utilized in moderate climates, however with enhancements in low temperature operation and reduced loads due to more effective homes, they are increasing in popularity in cooler environments.<p>

However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
