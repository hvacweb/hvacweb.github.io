<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
