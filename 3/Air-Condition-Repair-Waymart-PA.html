<h3>Is Your Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Waymart PA?</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes much more extreme with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more standard type of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heat pump during harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
