The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
