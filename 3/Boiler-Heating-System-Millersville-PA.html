<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has been used typically in a variety of building construction products for insulation and as a fire-retardant. EPA and CPSC have banned several asbestos items.

<p>As with a lot of house improvement jobs, the cost of a complete central heating unit can vary commonly based upon the size of the house. A lot of heating systems will last in between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, property owners must consider heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A small home, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too rapidly and shut off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>
