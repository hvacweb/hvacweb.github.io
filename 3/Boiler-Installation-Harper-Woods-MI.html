<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in your home are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
