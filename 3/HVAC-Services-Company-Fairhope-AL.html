<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate great however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
