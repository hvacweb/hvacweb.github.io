<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

Nevertheless, do not let your maintenance end with this yearly examination. While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system running at peak performance.<p>

The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank must be checked for leaks, the system must be flushed regularly to eliminate tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in tough water areas). The systems must be checked at least two times per year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed occasionally to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
