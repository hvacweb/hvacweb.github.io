<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter can intensify problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, animal dander, and mold spores flowing through your home.
