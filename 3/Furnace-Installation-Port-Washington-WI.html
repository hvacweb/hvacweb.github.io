<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same.

Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly harden and cure-- normally 2 to four weeks.
