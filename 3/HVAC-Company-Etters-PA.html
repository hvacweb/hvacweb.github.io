<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, however numerous utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better option. If the present system has not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and concerns that caused the breakdown can be identified and remedied, repairing the system can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
