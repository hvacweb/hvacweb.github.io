<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Westchester Illinois</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
