<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
