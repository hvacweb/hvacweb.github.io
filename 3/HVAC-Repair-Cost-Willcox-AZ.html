<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few reasonable ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up assessment outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
