<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. When the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly solidify and cure-- typically 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
