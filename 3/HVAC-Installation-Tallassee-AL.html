<p>Geothermal heatpump are extremely efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a constant temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling impact. Most ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every single system of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
