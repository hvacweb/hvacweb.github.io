<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable Energy section recommends that "Air Purification must have a Minimum Performance Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to reduce the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can act as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can minimize the efficiency of the coils.<p>
<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heating systems.

Your heating technician can set up controls which automatically shut down the heatpump if temperatures reach and drop listed below freezing. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
