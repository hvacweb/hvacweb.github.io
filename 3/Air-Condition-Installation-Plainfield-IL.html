<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

More than one case has actually included outdoor water fountains in public destinations.
