<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that might impact the health of people who reside in the house. Pollutants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin might likewise originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care items. Infections and bacteria, family pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
