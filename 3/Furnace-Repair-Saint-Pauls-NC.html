They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to heat up the concrete slab listed below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes.

<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ may see musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
