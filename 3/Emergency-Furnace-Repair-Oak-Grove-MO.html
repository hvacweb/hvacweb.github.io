<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your a/c unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Merely including refrigerant is not an option if it leakages. A skilled technician should fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the performance and effectiveness of your a/c is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's specification, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
