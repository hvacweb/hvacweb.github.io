<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
