Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

If the air quality is poor it can impact an individual's health, convenience, and performance.

Virtually all hydronic radiant flooring heat systems today use 1/2 inch size plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly flexible, will not rust and comes in long lengths, which permit PEX pipeline to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to two days might become a source for mold growth and should be discarded. In some cases there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
