As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>

If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk with your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
