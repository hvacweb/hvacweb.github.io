In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner boost. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
