<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
