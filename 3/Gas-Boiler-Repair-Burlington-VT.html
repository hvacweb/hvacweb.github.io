<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really useful in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
