<p>We look at clues prior to we offer recommendations to change rather than repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we know the system is not running effectively. It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size.

On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
