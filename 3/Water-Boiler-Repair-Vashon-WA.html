<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, steps must also be taken to reduce contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, citizens should be alert to the emergence of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization procedures should not be carried out up until these problems have actually been fixed.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very handy in collecting information on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
