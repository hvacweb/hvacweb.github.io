Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
