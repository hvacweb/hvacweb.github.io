<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to supply adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
