<p>I have been using them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again. He is sincere, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to find a sincere AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
