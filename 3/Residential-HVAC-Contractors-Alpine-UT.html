<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems at Alpine UT</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We chose getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
