<h3>Ventilation System in Holmdel New Jersey</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
