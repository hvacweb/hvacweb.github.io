<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractors in Borger</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

Exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon ends up being caught in structures and concentrations build up inside.<p>
