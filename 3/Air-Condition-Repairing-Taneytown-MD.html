<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
