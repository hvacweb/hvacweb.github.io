<p>Measurement treatments are being developed and shown to assess building ventilation and indoor pollutant concentrations. These procedures vary from sophisticated tracer gas approaches utilized mainly in constructing research efforts to less involved treatments that can be utilized by constructing operators.

The efforts in which these procedures are demonstrated in the field has led to the development of a crucial database of building ventilation and indoor air quality efficiency.<p>

<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your home might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, try to find indications of problems with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can suggest your house might not have adequate ventilation consist of wetness condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or smelly air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To find odors in your home, action outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
