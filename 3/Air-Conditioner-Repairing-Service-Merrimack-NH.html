Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, much of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
