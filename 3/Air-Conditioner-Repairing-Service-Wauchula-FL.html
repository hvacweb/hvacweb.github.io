<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Wauchula FL</h3>

Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling impact. Most ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0.
