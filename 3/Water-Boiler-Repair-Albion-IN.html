<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
