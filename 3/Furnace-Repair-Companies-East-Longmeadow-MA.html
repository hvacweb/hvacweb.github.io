<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. Connection concerns along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the unit. Loose, malfunctioning or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of keeping your furnace involves inspecting the advised connections along with temperature level and pressure assesses. Take some time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and safe and secure.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
