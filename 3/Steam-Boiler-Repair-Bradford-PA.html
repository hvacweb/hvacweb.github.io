<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>If you work in construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your hobby includes lead, you might unwittingly bring lead into your house on your clothing or hands.

Soil by roadways and highways may be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet prior to getting in the house. Change your clothes prior to you go house and clean these clothes separately if you work with lead in your task or a hobby. Encourage your children to play in sand and grassy locations rather of dirt which adheres to fingers and toys. Attempt to keep your children from consuming dirt, and make certain they wash their hands when they come inside.<p>
