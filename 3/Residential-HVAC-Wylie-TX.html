Buildings continuously evolve as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them as well as the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The various surface areas and the air inside a building are constantly communicating, and this interaction results in modifications in each.

In fact, the dirt" we see might be progressing as an outcome of the interactions amongst the wetness, chemicals, and biological materials discovered there.<p>
