<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Wrightsville GA?</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in autos in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by many individuals.<p>
