Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them till they have actually been appropriately dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
