<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 ought to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot.

Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
