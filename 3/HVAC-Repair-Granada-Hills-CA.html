<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractor in Granada Hills</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
