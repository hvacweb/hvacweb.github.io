<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
