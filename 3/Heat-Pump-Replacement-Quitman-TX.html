In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>
