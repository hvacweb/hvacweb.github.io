<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Hodgenville KY</h3>
<p>In-floor heater can feature certain health benefits. The hotter the air, the drier it becomes. On those days when you just can't appear to heat up and find you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating. In-floor heating systems are not prone to this concern since they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Moreover, since they do not rely upon fans, ducts, returns and registers to disperse hot air, in-floor heater can minimize the quantity of dust and seasonal allergens in your home.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
