Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
