<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The function of most building ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing safety at affordable energy costs. Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J computation and ought to be carried out by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or unit cost for a/c. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square video alone, move to another contractor. Similar to measuring the size of a system required based upon BTUs, determining the appropriate size of unit for your house likewise depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Picture 6).<p>
