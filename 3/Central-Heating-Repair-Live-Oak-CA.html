<h3>Knowing the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Live Oak CA</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while concurrently getting rid of waste gases and particulates. Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside your home or outdoors - can make it increasingly tough for your lungs to function correctly, and can have unfavorable health affects.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odor free gas that disrupts the shipment of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a range of signs from headaches, d izziness, weak point, confusion, nausea, and disorientation, to fatigue in healthy individuals and episodes of increased chest discomfort in individuals with chronic heart disease. The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are in some cases puzzled with the influenza or food poisoning. Fetuses, infants, senior individuals, and individuals with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory illness can be especially sensitive to carbon monoxide gas exposures.<p>
