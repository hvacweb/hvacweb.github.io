<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. An excellent place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification.

Kick it up a notch by searching for Building Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI certification understand that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one component (out of lots of) of a comfy environment.<p>
