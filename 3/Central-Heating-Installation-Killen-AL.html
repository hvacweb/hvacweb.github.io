<p>My oldest child constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I recognized that it actually didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did before.

The sound level is low and itÃ¢ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
