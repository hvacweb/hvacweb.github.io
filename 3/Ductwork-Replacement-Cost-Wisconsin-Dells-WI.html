<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heaters have multiple control panel. The largest, or only one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control board should be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
