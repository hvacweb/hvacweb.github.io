Routine maintenance can also result in enhanced efficiency and potentially extend your system's life in the long run.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>Start by checking out the installation handbook and acquainting yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. Many systems feature a kit that consists of adjustable window extensions and metal mounting brackets. These parts will guarantee a protected and airtight  fit in the window opening. And for additional support, specifically for larger a/c unit, consider purchasing a steel assistance bracket and mount it to the outdoors house wall, directly below the windowsill.<p>
