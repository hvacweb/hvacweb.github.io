<p>I am really impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years earlier and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.

<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit, think about potential impacts of indoor air pollution.

A persistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heater remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
