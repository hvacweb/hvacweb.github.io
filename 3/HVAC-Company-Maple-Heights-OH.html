<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>

<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
