<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
