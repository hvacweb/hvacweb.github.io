In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>
