<p>A customized air conditioning system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c unit in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air path. A standard ac system transfers heat energy out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside.
