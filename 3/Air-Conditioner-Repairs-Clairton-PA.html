<p>I have been using them for several years for my services, my own homes and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again. He is sincere, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
