<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
