<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
<p>Regardless of the type of electric radiant flooring heating system, all are factory-built to stay in one piece and not cut, broken or altered. Any interference or interruption in the circulation of electrical power makes the system unusable. This is one of the drawbacks to installing an electric radiant heat system. However, assuming they are set up properly and effectively looked after, the probability of them having problems is small.<p>
