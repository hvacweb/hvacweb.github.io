<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
