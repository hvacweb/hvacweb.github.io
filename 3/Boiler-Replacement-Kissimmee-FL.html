<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for several years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs all of a sudden appear higher than regular, it is probably time to consider a new system.

<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can become clogged with debris that can restrict airflow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to close down entirely. By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can normally be performed in simply a few minutes, typically without any tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
