<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
