<p>Learn More About PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a portion performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends on keeping it according to the maker's instructions.<p>
<p>The first a/c and refrigerators used hazardous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary environmental hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead gets in the body. Before it was understood how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
