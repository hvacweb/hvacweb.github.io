<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Construction and Commissioning is designed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other professionals concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of building products, smoking, family products, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in made products. For instance, it is utilized to add permanent-press qualities to clothes and draperies, as a component of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and finish products.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed.

Exposure to radon ends up being a concern when radon becomes caught in concentrations and buildings build up inside your home.<p>
