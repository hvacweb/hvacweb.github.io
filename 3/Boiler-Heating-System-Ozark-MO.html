<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes.

Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them up until they have been correctly dried. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent sees, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
