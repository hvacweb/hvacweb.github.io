<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " number one environmental hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are many ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how hazardous lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
<p>Many well and city water does not generally include lead. Water normally gets lead inside the home from household plumbing that is made with lead materials. The only method to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to discover how to get the water evaluated. Send for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for additional information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>Heating is also among the greatest energy customers in your house, so homeowners who might be shopping for a new furnace must thinking about changing it with a newer, more energy-efficient model to save money and assist the environment.
