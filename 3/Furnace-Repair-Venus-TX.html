<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and solidify-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
