<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Federal Way WA 98023</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good possibility; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on rare occasions.<p>
