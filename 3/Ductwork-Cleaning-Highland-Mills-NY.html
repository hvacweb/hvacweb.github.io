<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
