<h3>Window Air Conditioner in Bluffton South Carolina</h3>
<p>If no contaminant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not adequate to account for an increase in the number of workers in the area, stagnant air might also be an issue.<p>
<p>Some health results may appear soon after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures to a toxin. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate results are treatable and usually short-term. In some cases the treatment is just eliminating the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Soon after exposure to some indoor air toxins, signs of some illness such as asthma might appear, be exacerbated or intensified.<p>
