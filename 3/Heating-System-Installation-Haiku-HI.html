<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest will not begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your cooling system from flooding. Among the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent possibility; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on unusual celebrations.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an abnormally high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern.

While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
