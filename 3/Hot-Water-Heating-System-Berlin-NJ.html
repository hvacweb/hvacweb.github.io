Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>

<p>The properties and composition of the soil in an area can impact the rate at which heat is conducted through the ground.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
