<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not provide them.. Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the system has been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
