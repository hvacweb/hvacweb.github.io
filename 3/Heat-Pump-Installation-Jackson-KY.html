However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as crucial when it comes to central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
