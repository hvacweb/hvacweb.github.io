<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
