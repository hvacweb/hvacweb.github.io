We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same contaminants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a regular oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter as soon as every 3 months. Throughout high use months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>

Usually, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
