<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't provide off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
