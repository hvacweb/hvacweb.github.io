<h3>Air Condition Installation Near Me in Marion Ohio</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Dripping return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<h3>Discontinue Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at Marion OH</h3>
<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the a/c. I proceeded and purchased this Provider and I must state it gets the job done rather well. It takes very little time to warm up or cool off your home which is one of the things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had previously. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
