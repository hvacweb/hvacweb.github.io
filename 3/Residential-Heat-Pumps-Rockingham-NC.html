<p>All Points Heating provides house a/c, air conditioning system installation, air conditioning system maintenance that provide reputable, proven performance at high effectiveness.

<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Rockingham NC Home Owners</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really happy that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the air conditioner prior to you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We want we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
