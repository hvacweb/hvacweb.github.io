<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow.
