<h3>Heating And Cooling Contractors in Exeter New Hampshire</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
