<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<h3>Heating Company in Halethorpe MD 21227</h3>
<p>Many commercial buildings use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that become part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some buildings can also utilize natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outdoor air introduced into a space per an unit of time, and is frequently expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can find the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, air-conditioning and refrigerating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the skills or tools needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the essential equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician examine the system periodically.<p>
