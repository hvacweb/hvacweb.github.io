<h3>Which Exactly Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Apache Junction AZ?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his examination, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Apache Junction AZ 85120</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
