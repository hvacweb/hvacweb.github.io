<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
