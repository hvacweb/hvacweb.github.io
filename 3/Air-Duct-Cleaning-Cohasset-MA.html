<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
