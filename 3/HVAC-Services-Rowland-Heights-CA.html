<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
