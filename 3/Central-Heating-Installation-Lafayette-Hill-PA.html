<p>The reality is, air pollution in your home can be simply as bad - or even worse - than it is outdoors. And with the typical American spending 87% of their life inside your home, you 'd believe that indoor air quality would be something we 'd hear about more frequently. However do not stress!

<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>Initially, know that a majority of your central air and system cost will come from the unit itself. AC system costs start at $2,000 and can actually exceed $10,000 for larger houses. As you saw just recently, you need an appropriately-sized unit for your house. Otherwise, the AC will break down sooner than expected or your month-to-month energy costs will skyrocket. For that reason, you don't have total control regarding your AC unit product expenses.<p>
