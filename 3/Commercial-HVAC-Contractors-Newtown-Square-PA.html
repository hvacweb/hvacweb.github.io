<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
