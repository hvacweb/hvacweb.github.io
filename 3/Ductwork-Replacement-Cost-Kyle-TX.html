<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate terrific however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>All heating systems have some level of air purification. From one of the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some fundamental maintenance.
