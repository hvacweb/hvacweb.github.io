<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

The easiest way to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
