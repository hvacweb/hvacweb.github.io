Try to find the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central units are about 15% more efficient than basic designs. New residential central air conditioner standards went into result on January 1, 2015; see the efficiency standards for central air conditioners for details, and think about buying a system with a greater SEER than the minimum for higher savings.<p>

<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>The predominant health result related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
