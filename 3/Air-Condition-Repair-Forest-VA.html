<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
