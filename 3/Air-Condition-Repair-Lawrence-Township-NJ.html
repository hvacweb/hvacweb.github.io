<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives ask for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item.

Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
