<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly harden and cure-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
