<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, because it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical standards remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
