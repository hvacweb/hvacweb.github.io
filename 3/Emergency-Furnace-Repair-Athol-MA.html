<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Installation in Athol MA 01331</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially asked for. They satisfied my needs entirely by providing a professional quote with alternatives, without pressing additional items. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also quickly followed up with the necessary examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>When choosing which of the finest AC systems they must set up in their homes, there are a few primary things that house owners will desire to take into consideration. It really depends upon what you value the most in a top brand name central air conditioner. The major factors for a lot of homeowners will be the overall cost to set up the very best air conditioner brands, life expectancy of the AC system, service warranties used, energy performance (SEER ratings), and size of the system you require for your home's square footage (LOADS) to efficiently cool your home.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement tries to upsell you every time they pertain to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for 7 years, even though it was six months before the current one expired. She didn't need a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
