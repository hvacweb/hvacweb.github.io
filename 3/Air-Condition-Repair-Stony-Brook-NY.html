Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not offer off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
