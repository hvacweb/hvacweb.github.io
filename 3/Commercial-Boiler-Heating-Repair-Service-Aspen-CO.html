<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>

In some cases there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in surprise or hardly ever accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the moisture issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the area using established health department recommendations.<p>
