<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very practical in collecting details on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
