<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Pasadena TX</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in home building is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofings, floors, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor impurities and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>
