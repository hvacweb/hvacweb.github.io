<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
