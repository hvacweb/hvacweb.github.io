When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
