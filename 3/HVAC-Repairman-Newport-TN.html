<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that perfect temperature level throughout the year.

Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which generally includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems.
