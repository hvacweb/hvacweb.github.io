<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
