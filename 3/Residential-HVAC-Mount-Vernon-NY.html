<p>Just like most home enhancement projects, the cost of a full central heater can differ commonly based upon the size of the house. The majority of heating systems will last between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, property owners must think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace need to be matched to the size of the house. A little house, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too rapidly and shut off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature level levels.<p>
