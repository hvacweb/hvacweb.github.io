These convection heating units are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space cooling supplies optimum versatility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air.<p>
