<p>A customized air conditioner that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard a/c because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the very same air path. A basic a/c unit transfers heat out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, since all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is actually warmed, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
