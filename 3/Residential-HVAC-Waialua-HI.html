<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we suggest using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by serving as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of allowing heat to heat up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes.

<p>The primary health impact connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
