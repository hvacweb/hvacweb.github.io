<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We want we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil.

Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
