<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
