<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
