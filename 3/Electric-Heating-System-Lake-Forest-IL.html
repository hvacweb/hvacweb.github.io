<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct.
