<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
