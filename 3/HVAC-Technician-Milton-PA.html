<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, houses and schools matters, especially because we invest the majority of our lives indoors. A/c help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very damp environments or in cases where the air conditioner is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your home. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Great Product! Delivery was kind of unusual being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window.
