<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit increase.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%.
