<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit increase.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
