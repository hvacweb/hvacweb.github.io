<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement tries to upsell you every time they pertain to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was 6 months before the present one expired. She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
