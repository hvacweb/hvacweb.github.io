<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and utilized by licensed HVAC specialists. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by numerous people.<p>
