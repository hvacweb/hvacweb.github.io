Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
