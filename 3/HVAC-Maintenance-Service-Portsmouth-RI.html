<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Portsmouth RI?</h3>
<p>The types of heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems are as various as the various houses they serve (single family houses, duplexes, mobile houses, houses, high-rise condominiums, row real estate, and so on). No matter what the type of house HVAC system, appropriate air circulation (ventilation), proper filtering, and humidity manage all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will ensure that it is running securely and not contributing to or causing an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
