<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
