<p>A specialized a/c unit that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a basic air conditioning unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the very same air course. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, since all parts of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
