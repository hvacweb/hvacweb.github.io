A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
