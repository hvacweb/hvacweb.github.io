<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new houses are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the house. Some of these designs consist of energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers). For additional information about air-to-air heat exchangers, contact the Preservation and Renewable Resource Inquiry and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
