<p>Some HVAC specialists offer service contracts to their clients, providing regular maintenance of heating and cooling systems. In some circumstances, other tradespeople will work with HVAC techs to help install or repair cooling and heating unit.

<p>Our indoor air quality specialists can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To decrease contaminants, we suggest installing innovative air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are developed to remove the tiniest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sterilization systems also help control germs and natural odors. Most store-bought filters can not eliminate these tiniest of allergens and don't remove gases and bacteria.<p>
<p>You could upgrade to the greatest effectiveness equipment readily available and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are just part of the central air system. The average home's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower units, your technician must run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining how much air escapes the system.<p>
