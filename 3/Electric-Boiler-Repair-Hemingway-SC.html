<h3>HVAC Services Company in Hemingway SC 29554</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>We look at ideas before we supply advice to replace instead of repair a heater. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher every year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It might be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing money by not changing the older unit.<p>
