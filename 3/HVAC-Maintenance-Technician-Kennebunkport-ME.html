<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by animals and people; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
