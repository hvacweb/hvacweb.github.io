<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
