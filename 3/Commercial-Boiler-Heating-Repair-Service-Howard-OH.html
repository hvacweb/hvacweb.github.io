<p>The probability of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends on several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential impacts.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
