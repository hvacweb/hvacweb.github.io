<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are delicate to indoor allergens or have respiratory problems, winter can intensify problems. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores distributing through your home. In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too cold to throw open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it is essential to be knowledgeable about a few of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that may be prowling in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly might become clogged, lowering air flow quality, volume, and circulation.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
