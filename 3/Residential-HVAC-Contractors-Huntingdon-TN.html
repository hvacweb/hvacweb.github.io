<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Huntingdon TN</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics recently, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
