The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power needs to not go beyond the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%.

Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
