<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in Athens TX</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in home construction is to reduce air leak through fractures and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofs. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
