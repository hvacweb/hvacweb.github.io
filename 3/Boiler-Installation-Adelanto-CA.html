<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
