<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time.

I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
