<p>A customized a/c that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard ac system because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air path. A standard ac system transfers heat out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, since all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is really heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
