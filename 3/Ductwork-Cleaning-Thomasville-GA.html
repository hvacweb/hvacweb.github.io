They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to buy it. My partner stated that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent people I have actually fulfilled in a long period of time.
