<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractor in Erie</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>

<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company utilized 98% of the existing product acquired with your house.
