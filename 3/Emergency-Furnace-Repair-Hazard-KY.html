Unlike convection heating, convected heat systems have no ductwork and no air circulation. Glowing systems depend on heat transfer by the infrared scientific concept used by the sun called line of vision." These unnoticeable electromagnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In a contained system like a house, the warmer items naturally heat the cooler ones up until a balance is attained.<p>
