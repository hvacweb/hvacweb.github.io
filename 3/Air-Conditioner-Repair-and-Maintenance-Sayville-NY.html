Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
