<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Performance and Renewable Energy section suggests that "Air Filtering ought to have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are utilized to decrease the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils.

<h3>The Way to Maintain Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Dallas TX</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in house building is to reduce air leak through fractures and other openings in roofings, walls, and floorings. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air assists and dilutes indoor contaminants tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Numerous factors impact IAQ. These elements include bad ventilation (absence of outside air), problems controlling temperature, low or high humidity, recent renovation, and other activities in or near a building that can impact the fresh air entering the structure. Sometimes, specific impurities like dust from building and construction or renovation, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals released as a gas gradually) might cause bad IAQ.<p>
