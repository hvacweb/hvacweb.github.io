<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Lexington VA</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions require.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
