"Humidifier fever" is a typical illness triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs.

Since it merely takes more electricity to run a larger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off prior to it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
