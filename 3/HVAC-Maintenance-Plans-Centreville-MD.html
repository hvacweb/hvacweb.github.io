<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay items. Because they only partly eliminate the radon decay items and do not reduce the amount of radon entering the home, the efficiency of these gadgets is unsure. EPA plans to do extra research study on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a reliable means of lowering the health risk from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, supplies additional details on air-cleaning gadgets to reduce indoor air pollutants.<p>

<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a house heating system, you may look for a heatpump more geared toward cooling capability and efficiency. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to search for a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can fail in the very hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
