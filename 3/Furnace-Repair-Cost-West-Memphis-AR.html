<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties remain in place. Moreover, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically tough to measure, as one action specified the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or ac system don't just break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of repetitive use of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing early wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.  a very beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
