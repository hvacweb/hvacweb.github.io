<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
