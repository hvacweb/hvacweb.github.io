<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are generally just offered for larger houses due to their high power and capacity.

For that reason, this might not be the very best option for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
