<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio.

<h3>Gas Heating in East Brunswick New Jersey</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 major components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Speaking of air, radiant heat systems tend to improve indoor air quality.

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps people working. When a sales guy concerns your home he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and ought to not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the alternatives for your requirements and you choose if you require it.<p>

<p>The icing problem becomes far more serious with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are frequently installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used rather of the heat pump throughout harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
