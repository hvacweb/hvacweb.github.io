<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated delay functions when they're shut down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes.

If you have actually installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
