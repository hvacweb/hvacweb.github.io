<p>Central air units are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>

High-efficiency designs cost more, but conserve more over the long run. Rates for gas furnaces range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency designs approximately $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric furnaces start at $395 and vary up to $1,700 or more depending upon the brand and furnace size.<p>

Additional research is needed to better comprehend which health results take place after exposure to the average contaminant concentrations discovered in houses and which take place from the greater concentrations that occur for brief amount of times.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is typically essential to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can often be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent need to ask for that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Evaluation of this information might identify potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on information might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
