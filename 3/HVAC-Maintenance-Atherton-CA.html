<p>Central air units are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>

High-efficiency designs cost more, but conserve more over the long run. Rates for gas furnaces range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency designs approximately $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric furnaces start at $395 and vary up to $1,700 or more depending upon the brand and furnace size.<p>
