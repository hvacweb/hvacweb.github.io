<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
