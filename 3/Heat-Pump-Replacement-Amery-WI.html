<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the building or remodelling of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate products of insufficient combustion.
