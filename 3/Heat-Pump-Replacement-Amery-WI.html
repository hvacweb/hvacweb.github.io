<p>The exhaust outlets allow all hazardous gases to escape your home so there's no risky buildup of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. They can lead to an unsafe accumulation and jeopardize your security if the exhaust outlets are blocked.

They will try to find indications of corrosion, leaks, and back draft and repair the issue during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the building or remodelling of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can likewise produce particulates and must be vented outside.<p>

Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
