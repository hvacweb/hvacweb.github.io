<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your financial investment by just using the services of a certified contractor or a certified agent from an organisation or merchant to do the installation. If you select to try to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed individual to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the cooling system.
