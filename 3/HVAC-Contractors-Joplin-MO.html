<p>My eldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area.
