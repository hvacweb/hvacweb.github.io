<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of industrial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private areas.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
