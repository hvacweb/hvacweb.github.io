<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Shelley ID</h3>
<p>In-floor heating unit can feature certain health advantages. The hotter the air, the drier it becomes. On those days when you simply can't appear to heat up and find you require to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses throbbing.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
