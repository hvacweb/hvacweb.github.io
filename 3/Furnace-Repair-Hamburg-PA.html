<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Hamburg PA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We decided on getting something more expensive than a standard water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

No additional charge.<p>
