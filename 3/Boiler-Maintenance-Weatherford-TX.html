<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>. Before choosing the installation place of a/c, numerous main factors need to be thought about. First of all, the instructions of air flow from the indoor systems need to not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there must not be any challenges en route of the air flow that may prevent it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible. The outdoor system must also be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively released outside and the efficiency of the entire system will drop sharply. It is highly suggested to install the air conditioning unit units in quickly accessible places, for additional maintenance throughout operation.<p>
<p>Its special feature is the presence of one primary external unit that linked to a number of indoor systems. Such systems might be the ideal option for maintaining the microclimate in numerous offices, stores, big living spaces. Just few of outside units do not intensify the visual appearance of the structure. The main external unit can be linked to several various indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, and so on<p>
