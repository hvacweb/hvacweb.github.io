<p>I usually don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
