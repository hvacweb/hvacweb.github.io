Supervisors with BPI accreditation understand that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one component (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately treat and solidify-- typically 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
