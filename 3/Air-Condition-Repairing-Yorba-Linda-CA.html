<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Yorba Linda CA?</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We chose getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter.

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
