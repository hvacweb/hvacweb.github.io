<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
