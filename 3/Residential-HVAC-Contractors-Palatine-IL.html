<h3>HVAC Technician in Palatine IL 60074</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces are typically not extremely efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however a lot of do not attain a performance higher than 90%.

Because a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were great! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my requirements entirely by offering an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the essential assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
