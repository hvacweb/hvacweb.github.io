Many home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors eliminate contaminants straight from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: They were great! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They met my requirements totally by offering a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also immediately followed up with the needed assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract attempts to upsell you every time they come to perform routine maintenance?

She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
