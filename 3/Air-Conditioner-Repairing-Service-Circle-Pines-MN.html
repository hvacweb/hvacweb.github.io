<p>Enhance your services, earn more services income, and provide an amazing customer experience. To make certain the system you pick is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load estimation quote to figure out the exact type of heat and cooling system that's just right for your home-we don't just change it with the very same size system you presently have. These calculations consider things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is essential so the system isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being clogged with particles that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can typically be done in simply a couple of minutes, often with no tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
