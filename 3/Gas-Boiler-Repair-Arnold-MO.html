<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced.
