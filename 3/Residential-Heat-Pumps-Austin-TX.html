<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
