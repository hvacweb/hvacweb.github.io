<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. Connection concerns along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the unit. Loose, missing or malfunctioning wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service.
