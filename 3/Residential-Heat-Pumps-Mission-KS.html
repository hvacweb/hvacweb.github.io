<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A split a/c includes 2 main parts - a compressor situated outside and an inside air outlet system. Unlike a system that requires a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, divided a/c rely on a set of pipes to link the outdoor to the within air system which is why there are referred to as a ductless mini-split ac system installation Refrigerant is dispersed through the copper pipes that cycle through the system to generate either heated or cold air.<p>
