<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to correctly service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
