<p>These people have been great. At a real estate agent, I sometimes require contractors to offer me an opinion for what work on a house may cost. Just recently I required to get in touch with these people twice. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the sincerity. Integrity isn't just their name, its a business design they take seriously. You people are formally on speed dial. Speak with you soon.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can shut and overheat down. You'll experience periodic durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Shut off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the a/c service still does not work appropriately after you've cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work totally unless you do this.<p>
