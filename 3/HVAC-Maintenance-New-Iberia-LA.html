<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in New Iberia LA 70560</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
