<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
