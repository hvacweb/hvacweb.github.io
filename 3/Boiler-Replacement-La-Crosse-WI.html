<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends upon the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, variety in price from $2,500 to $7,500, consisting of installation. Geothermal heat pumps usually need excavation to install, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
