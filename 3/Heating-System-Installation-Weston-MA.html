Winter utilized to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>

<p>I am changing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends on the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps typically require excavation to set up, which adds a number of thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for property owners to think about. Many times, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, considering that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally just available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best option for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
