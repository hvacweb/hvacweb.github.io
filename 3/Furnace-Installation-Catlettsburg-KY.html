<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an uncommonly high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern.

<p>Usually the most reliable way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside ought to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
