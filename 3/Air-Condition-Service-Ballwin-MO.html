He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
