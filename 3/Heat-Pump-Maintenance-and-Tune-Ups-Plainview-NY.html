<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the system has actually been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
