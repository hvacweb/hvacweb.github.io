<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Care Tips in Fruitland Park FL</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your a/c and heatpump need to be without all obstructions and particles. Clogs can block the circulation of condensed water and trigger wetness accumulation within the system. Excess wetness can trigger problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the home, irregular temperature level regulation, germs, and jeopardized air quality. A professional maintenance technician will flush and clean up the condensate drain to make sure all excess moisture streams away from the system.<p>
