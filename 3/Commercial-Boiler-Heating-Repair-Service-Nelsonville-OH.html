<h3>Ducted Air Conditioning Prices in Nelsonville OH 45764</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely comprehensive in discussing what services would be performed. Also Camryn provided fantastic customer care at the end of the visit by explaining precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies used by some in the industry.<p>
