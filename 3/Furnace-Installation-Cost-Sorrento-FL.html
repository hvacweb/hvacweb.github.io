<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation later on).

The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
