<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can become blocked with debris that can limit air flow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Unclean filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down totally. By contrast, examining and replacing a furnace filter can typically be carried out in just a few minutes, typically without any tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
