<p>Fact: Federal and local rewards generally total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary rate of a system competitive with conventional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, during new building (homes generally use in between one and five loads). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. However, new installation practices are decreasing expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to standard systems under the best conditions.<p>
