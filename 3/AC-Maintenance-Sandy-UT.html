<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
