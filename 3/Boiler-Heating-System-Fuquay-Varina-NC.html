<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor at Fuquay Varina NC</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
