<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash can be found in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
