<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of people who live in the house. Contaminants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into your house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could likewise come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care products. Germs and viruses, family pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold.

She didn't require a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
