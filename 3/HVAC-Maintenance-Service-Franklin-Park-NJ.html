<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no contaminant sources are found. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not adequate to account for an increase in the number of workers in the area, stagnant air might likewise be a problem.<p>
<p>After setting up a new furnace, think about combining it with indoor air quality items to develop a safe and healthy  home. When working with a range of indoor air quality options, your heater can help reduce pollutants, chemical vapors, viruses, dust, and more.

<p>The bottom line is to secure your investment by just utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a certified representative from a service or seller to do the installation.
