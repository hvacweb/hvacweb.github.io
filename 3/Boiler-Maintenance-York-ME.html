<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
