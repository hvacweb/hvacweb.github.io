<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heater, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space.

As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
