The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
