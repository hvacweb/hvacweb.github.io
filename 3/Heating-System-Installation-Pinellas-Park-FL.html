<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had actually spotted the problem location in examining the expense. He fixed the problem in one day, had actually changed the bill to what I considered fair prior to he called back, knew what might have caused the problem and had a plan to insure that it would not happen once again. I have actually thought about All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but many use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a better option.
