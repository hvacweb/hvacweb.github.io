<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>The installation was quick, professional and very well done. The installers were polite and understood precisely what to do. I am an engineer by profession and acknowledge easily people who are proficient at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are great and do not miss information that produces a job extremely well done. I very extremely recommend the 2 gentlemen as they are exceptional at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and appreciation for a job well done.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation also depends upon the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, variety in rate from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heatpump usually need excavation to set up, which includes a number of thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
