Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
