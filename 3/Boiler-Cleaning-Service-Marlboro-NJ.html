<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
