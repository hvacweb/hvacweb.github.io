<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
