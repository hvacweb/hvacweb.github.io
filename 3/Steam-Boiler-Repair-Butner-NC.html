<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
