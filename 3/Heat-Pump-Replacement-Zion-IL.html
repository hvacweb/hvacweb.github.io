<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
