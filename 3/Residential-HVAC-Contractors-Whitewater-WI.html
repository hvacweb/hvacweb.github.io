Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
