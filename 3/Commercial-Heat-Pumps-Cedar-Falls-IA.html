<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Cedar Falls IA</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
