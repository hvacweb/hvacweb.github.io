<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power should not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor system.

Nevertheless, the estimation of the overall power is not basic, since it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
