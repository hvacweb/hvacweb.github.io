Usage fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls work to guarantee the fans run for a sufficient amount of time.

To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
