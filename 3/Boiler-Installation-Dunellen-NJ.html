<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Nick B. supplied exceptional, customized, mindful, and quality service. His interaction design is friendly, efficient and interesting. He clearly and thoroughly described all problems and fixes in a manner that made me confident in his capability to fix my repair problems. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally pick up a required part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my better half and I would not have to endure another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winters in recent memory. He likewise reacted to my call immediately the next early morning, and coached me through a short-term fix to an issue that couldn't be resolved on the first visit due to unavailable parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and capability to deliver consistent, quality service.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
