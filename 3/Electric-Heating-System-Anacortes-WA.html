<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might discover unpleasant or moldy odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>
