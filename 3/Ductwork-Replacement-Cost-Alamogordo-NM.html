Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00.

<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was sort of odd being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we fixed concerns. I would recommend this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time.

<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is utilized to transport the heat to the rooms. The majority of contemporary hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the distribution system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ).

The radiators may be installed on walls or set up within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
