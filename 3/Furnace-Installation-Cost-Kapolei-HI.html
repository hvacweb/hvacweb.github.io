<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
