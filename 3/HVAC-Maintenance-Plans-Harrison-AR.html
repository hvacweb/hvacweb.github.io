<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

Commercial and residential building contractors might be your finest long-lasting leads since they build homes and commercial structures from the ground up. Restoration job managers might want a HVAC professional to determine if a heating or air conditioning system must be fixed or replaced. These companies might also need guidance on which ENERGY STAR equipment is the very best suited for the size of a recently built home.<p>
<p>The majority of respectable HVAC technicians will use free estimates with an in-person service call. Beware of HVAC contractors who try to provide you a complimentary quote over the phone, as it may not properly reflect what they will find when they check out the system.
