<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
