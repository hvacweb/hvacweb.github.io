<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, as opposed to commercial or outside settings. For example, promoting maintenance services to existing consumers throughout the slow season can help ease the peak season strain on your tech crew, as noted in Cooling, Heating and Refrigeration (ACHR) News Professionals can mainly focus on reacting to calls from new customers, while your established clients remain pleased as their HVAC systems hum along nicely thanks to proactive examinations.

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton.
