<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments used to determine co2 should be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
