<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>
