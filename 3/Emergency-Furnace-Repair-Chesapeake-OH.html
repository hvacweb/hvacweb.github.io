<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
