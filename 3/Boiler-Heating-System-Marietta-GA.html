Heaters that kick on often might be because of a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>

<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years ago and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
