<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a properly sized system. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate due to the fact that it merely takes more electricity to run a larger system. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
