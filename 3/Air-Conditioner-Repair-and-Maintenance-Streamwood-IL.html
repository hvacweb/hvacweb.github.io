<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
