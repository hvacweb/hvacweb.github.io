<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis.

<p>Place the solar storage tank near the standard hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, make certain that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available.

If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
