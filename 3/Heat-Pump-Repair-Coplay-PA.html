<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Utilize or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical technique of reducing exposure to indoor air contaminants, also will minimize but not eliminate exposure to ecological tobacco smoke.

In addition, the large increases in ventilation it requires to significantly lower direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs considerably. Consequently, the most efficient method to decrease direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the home is to remove smoking cigarettes there.<p>
