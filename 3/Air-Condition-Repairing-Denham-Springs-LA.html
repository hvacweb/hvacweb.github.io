<p>The compressor can get too hot and shut down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience periodic durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Turn off the power.

Then tug the disconnect block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work properly after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work totally unless you do this.<p>
