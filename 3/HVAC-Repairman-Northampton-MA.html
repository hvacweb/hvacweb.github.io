<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S).

<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may see unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
