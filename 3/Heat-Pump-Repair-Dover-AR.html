Permeable products, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 48 hours may end up being a source for mold development and need to be discarded. Often there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can thrive in surprise or seldom accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the moisture problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
