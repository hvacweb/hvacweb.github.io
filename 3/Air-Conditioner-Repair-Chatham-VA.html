<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in place. In addition, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically difficult to quantify, as one action specified the savings in performance or repairs that were avoided.

For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, causing holes and fractures. , if that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.. a very advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
