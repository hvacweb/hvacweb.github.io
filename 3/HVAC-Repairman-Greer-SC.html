<h3>AC Replacement Service in Greer SC 29651</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
