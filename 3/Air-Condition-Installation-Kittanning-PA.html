<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
