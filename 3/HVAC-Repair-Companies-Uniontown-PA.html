Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
