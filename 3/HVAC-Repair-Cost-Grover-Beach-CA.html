<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Construction and Commissioning is developed for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other specialists concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of building products, smoking cigarettes, household products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating units.
