<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Since up to 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated performance benefit. Since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Since a system is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
