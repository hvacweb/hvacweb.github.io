<p>Trace was the service technician that looked after my semi annual maintenance today. Trace was on time, polite, and respected my house by always wearing boot coverings when entering my home. He demonstrated the points of assessment and also recommended I have a UV light installed due to a little accumulation of mold accumulating in the air handler, which he thoroughly checked and cleaned the exterior compressor coils along with ensured the moisture discharge tube was clear by using a cleaning liquid and a shop vacuum. He also eliminated the leaves that built up inside the interior of the compressor system and recommended a solution to prevent it from continuing, which will do.I got a detailed e-mail report of the inspection outlining all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is an asset to Waychoff's and I highly suggest him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface area ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down quickly. This is an extremely common repair. If your furnace is more than ten years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, think about having the ignitor and flame sensing unit replaced as preventative maintenance because the cost will be less when the technician is already there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>

<p>Inspect these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your home are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
