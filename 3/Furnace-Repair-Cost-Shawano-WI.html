<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
