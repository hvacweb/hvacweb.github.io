<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the go to. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the new part.
