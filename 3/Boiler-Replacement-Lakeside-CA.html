<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside system as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
