<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Jessup MD 20794</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the abilities or tools necessary to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and correct airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still needed to have a professional technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
