<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
