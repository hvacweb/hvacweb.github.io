<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals used in the building and construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances).

Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to eliminate products of incomplete combustion.
