<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Many people undervalue the degree of the indoor air contamination problem. Air contamination is typically visualized as the black smoke given off from factories.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
