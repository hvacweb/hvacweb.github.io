<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
