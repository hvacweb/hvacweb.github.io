<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
