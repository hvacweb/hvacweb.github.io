Today's furnaces are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which may be ranked as low as 80% effectiveness, this can indicate considerable cost savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the conventional water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, make certain that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible. If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is likely that it is supported by the pipes. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
