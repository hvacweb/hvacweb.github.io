<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a big retailer who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperatures in stores to save on costs (particularly during the night) and to alert store supervisors if temperature levels in the shops vary beyond an acceptable range that could prevent clients from shopping at the store.<p>
