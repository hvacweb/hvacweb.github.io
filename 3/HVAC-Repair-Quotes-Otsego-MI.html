<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, however a homeowner does not have the tools or skills needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still required to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>

Demand heats up throughout the summer and winter when customers require their HVAC systems repaired for relief versus the cold and heat; service calls drop off when milder weather condition arrives.<p>
