Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the exterior of the unit and ensure that there is no rust, damage from collected wetness, or extreme wear to the outside. They might suggest that you trim thick trees or bushes to make sure sufficient airflow around the unit.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
