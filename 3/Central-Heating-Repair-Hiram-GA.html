<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be changed ultimately. As equipment ages, it ends up being less effective.

<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing material acquired with your home.
