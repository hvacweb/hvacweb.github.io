<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier.
