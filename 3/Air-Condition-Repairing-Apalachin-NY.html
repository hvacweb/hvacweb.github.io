<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a large merchant who asked not to be called since he did not have consent to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a group that regularly monitors energy intake and temperatures in shops to save on expenses (especially in the evening) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the stores fluctuate beyond an appropriate variety that could prevent clients from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website.
