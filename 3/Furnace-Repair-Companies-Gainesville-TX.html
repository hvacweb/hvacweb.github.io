<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
