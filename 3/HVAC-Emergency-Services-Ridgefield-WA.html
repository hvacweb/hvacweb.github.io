<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling residents. Unlike other types of a/c, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be permitted to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to maintain and comprehend.<p>
