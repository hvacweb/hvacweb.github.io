<h3>Central Heating Repair in Pearl MS 39208</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
