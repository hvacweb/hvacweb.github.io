<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
