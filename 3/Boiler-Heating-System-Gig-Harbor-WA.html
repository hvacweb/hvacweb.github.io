<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.
