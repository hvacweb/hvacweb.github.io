<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Mobile AL - Reasons Why You Would Need to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>The remainder of the HVAC system likewise needs to be in leading condition for the air conditioning unit to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which live inside the house. The technician can examine the ductwork for signs of holes, gaps or excessive dirt if the individual parts are in proper order. Sealing leaks in ductwork can enhance HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and offer a cooler house in the hot summer season.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
