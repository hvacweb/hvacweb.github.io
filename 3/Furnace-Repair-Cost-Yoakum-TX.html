<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
