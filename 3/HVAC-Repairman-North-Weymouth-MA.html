We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants.

<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor. You can often conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the opportunities are good that this might work for one cycle, however the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's finest to change the capacitor.<p>
<p>Some health results may appear quickly after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures to a contaminant. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate results are treatable and typically short-term. Sometimes the treatment is merely removing the individual's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Right after exposure to some indoor air pollutants, signs of some illness such as asthma might show up, be worsened or gotten worse.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan must spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins however the fan does not. Turn off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan begins. , if it doesn't, you have actually provided it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
