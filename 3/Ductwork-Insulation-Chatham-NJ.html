Even when it was news my client most likely wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a business model they take seriously. You people are formally on speed dial. Speak to you soon.<p>
<p>Nick B. offered extraordinary, individualized, attentive, and quality service. His interaction design gets along, interesting and effective.
