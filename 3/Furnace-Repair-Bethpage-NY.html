<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in Bethpage New York</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the visit. They advised changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be using them again.<p>
<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers used different methods. The CMHC study called on several duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they were part of a research study, and the researchers did not control for time invested or techniques used. The EPA research study prescribed and controlled methods used on a smaller sized number of homes. While the duct-cleaning market argues both research studies have defects, no other research study has challenged the findings. And although the equipment and techniques used by duct-cleaning companies have actually changed considering that these research studies were carried out, the air ducts in homes haven't.<p>
