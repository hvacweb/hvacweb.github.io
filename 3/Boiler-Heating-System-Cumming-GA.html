<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, much of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed if it becomes damp.<p>
