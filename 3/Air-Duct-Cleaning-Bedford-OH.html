<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>
