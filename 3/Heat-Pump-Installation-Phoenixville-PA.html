<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
