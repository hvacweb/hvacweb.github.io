<p>Simplify your services, make more services revenue, and offer a fantastic customer experience. To ensure the unit you pick is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load calculation estimate to figure out the exact type of heat and air conditioning system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply replace it with the same size system you presently have.

This action is important so the system isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>The first air conditioners and fridges utilized combustible or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
