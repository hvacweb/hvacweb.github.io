<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, a lot of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
