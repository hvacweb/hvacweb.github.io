<p>Heating systems resemble cars and trucks. As they age, you can change one part only need another part changed or fixed next year. It doesn't take long to spend $500 simply to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heaters incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair indication is whether you had to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets harder to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be actually cold on a below no night.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it might suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
