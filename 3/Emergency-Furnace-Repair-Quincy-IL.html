<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC company owner need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
