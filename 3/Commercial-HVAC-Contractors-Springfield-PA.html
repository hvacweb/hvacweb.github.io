<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces in Springfield PA</h3>
<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that deals with indoor air quality issues. In the lack of such legislation, the "general task clause" applies. This clause, common to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, states that an employer should provide a safe and healthy  office. Thus, making sure the air is of good quality is the employer's task.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
