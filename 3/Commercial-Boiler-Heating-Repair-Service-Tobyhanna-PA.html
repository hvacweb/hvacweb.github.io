<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
