<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>

Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
