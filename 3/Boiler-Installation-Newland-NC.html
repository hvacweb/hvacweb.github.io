<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>

<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is allowed to rise and stream out high building openings to the outside (stack result ), triggering cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation plans can use very little energy, however care must be required to ensure comfort. In warm or damp climates, maintaining thermal comfort entirely via natural ventilation might not be possible. Cooling systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also use outdoors air to condition spaces, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when proper.<p>
