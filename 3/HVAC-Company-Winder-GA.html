<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, since it is secured indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely.

<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
