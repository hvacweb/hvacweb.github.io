<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Make certain all the signs up in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
