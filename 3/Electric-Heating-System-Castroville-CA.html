<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power must not go beyond the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the very same time, because the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the spaces may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not simple, given that it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
