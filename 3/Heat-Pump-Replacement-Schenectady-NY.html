In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the building. It might likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private areas.<p>
