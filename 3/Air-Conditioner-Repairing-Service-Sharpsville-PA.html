Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can mean considerable savings in annual heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>

<h3>Gas Furnace Repair in Sharpsville Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Making use of air filters can trap a few of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable resource area recommends that "Air Filtration must have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are utilized to minimize the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can function as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can reduce the efficiency of the coils.<p>
<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating systems. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperatures reach freezing. If temperatures reach and drop below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which instantly shut down the heat pump. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>
<p>Even after carrying out these tasks to increase the efficiency and longevity of your Seattle HVAC system, you must contact an expert to take on problems quickly when they develop and perform thorough maintenance once a year or as needed.
