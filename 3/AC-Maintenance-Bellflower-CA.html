<p>Immediate results may show up after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant impacts are treatable and normally short-term. Sometimes the treatment is simply removing the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Signs of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise show up soon after exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>The primary health impact related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
