<p>Air pollutants can range from impurities generated from the outdoors by your pets to unsafe gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air contaminant arising from natural gas that escapes into your home without being burnt. Older homes might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where moisture levels are typically higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Often a short-term indoor air quality issue is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more complex problems-- identified by consistently undesirable air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 tactics below may be proper.<p>
