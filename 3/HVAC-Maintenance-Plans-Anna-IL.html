<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Anna IL Home Owners</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
