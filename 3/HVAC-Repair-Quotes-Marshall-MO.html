<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use auto debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
