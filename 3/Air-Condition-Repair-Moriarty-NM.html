Due to the fact that they heat surfaces and not the air itself, in-floor heating systems are not vulnerable to this problem. Furthermore, because they do not trust fans, ducts, registers and returns to disperse hot air, in-floor heater can minimize the amount of dust and seasonal allergens in your house.<p>
