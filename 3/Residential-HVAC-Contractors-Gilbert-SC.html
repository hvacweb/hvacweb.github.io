<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system independently, since the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are typically just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capability.
