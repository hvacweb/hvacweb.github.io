Lots of common building products used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Usually, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation.
