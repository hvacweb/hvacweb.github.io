<p>Utilize or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common technique of minimizing direct exposure to indoor air contaminants, also will minimize but not get rid of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Since smoking produces such big quantities of contaminants, natural or mechanical ventilation methods do not eliminate them from the air in your home as quickly as they build up. In addition, the large boosts in ventilation it requires to substantially lower exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses substantially. Consequently, the most reliable way to lower exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the home is to get rid of cigarette smoking there.<p>
