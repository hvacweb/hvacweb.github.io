<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.
