<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
