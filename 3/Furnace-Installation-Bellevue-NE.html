<p>Specialist heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists suggest following this fundamental guideline when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost majority the rate of a new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
