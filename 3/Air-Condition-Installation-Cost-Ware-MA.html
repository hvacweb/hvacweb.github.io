<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, since it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
