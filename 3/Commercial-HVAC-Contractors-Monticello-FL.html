<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, see Eric's Garage today.<p>

Actually every structure in Columbus or Franklin County, Ohio or the United States has some sort of environment control system installed.<p>
