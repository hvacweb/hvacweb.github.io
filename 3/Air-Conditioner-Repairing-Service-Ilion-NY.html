<p>The predominant health result associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
