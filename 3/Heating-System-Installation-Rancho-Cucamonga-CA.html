Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
