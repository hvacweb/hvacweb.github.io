<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
