Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>

<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory guarantees stay in location. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is often tough to measure, as one response specified the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c do not just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of repetitive usage of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, causing holes and fractures. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.  an extremely helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
