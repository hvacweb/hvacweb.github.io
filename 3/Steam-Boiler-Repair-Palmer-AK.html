<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
