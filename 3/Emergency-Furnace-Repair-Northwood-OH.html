<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. Try a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke.

Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.

Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
