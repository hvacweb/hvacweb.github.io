The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined insufficient ventilation as the main issue in more than half the workplace indoor air investigations it has actually performed.

These investigations revealed that correct ventilation is very important in keeping great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.
