<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
