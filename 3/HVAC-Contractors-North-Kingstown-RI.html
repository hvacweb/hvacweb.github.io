This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioner will not cool however you can hear it running, it might simply need to be cleaned up. Whether this is the reason for the problem, it's a good early solution to attempt. Strategy to do this on a fairly warm day. Never ever utilize a power washer for this-- it can damage the fins.
