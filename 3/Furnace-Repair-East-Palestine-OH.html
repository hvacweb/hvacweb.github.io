<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it really rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a house heater, you might look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capacity and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to search for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the extremely hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>

When the worst takes place, do not panic. Fox Pipes & Heating proudly serves Seattle, Renton, and surrounding locations.<p>
