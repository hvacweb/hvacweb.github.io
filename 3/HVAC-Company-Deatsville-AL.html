<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater.

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
