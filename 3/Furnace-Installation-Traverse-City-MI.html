<p>A health questionnaire should be established and dispersed to all concerned employees. Such a tool should recognize the number of people affected; specify ages and task descriptions of involved employees; identify where they lie within the office; suggest when the signs occur (time of day, day of week, and time of year); provide a list of specific health signs or diseases; determine all devices operated in the office; suggest the type of outdoors air pollution; and identify prospective sources of job tension.<p>
<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of individuals who reside in the house. Pollutants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon entering your home from the ground listed below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care items. Infections and germs, family pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
