The Regulation prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system air conditioning", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floorings, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the ac system to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up.
