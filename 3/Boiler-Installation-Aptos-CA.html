<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

<h3>What Exactly Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Aptos CA?</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>It can sometimes be tough to determine when you need to require air conditioning repair. Do you set up a repair each time you hear an unusual noise or notice odd behavior coming from your AC system, or exist some harmless peculiarities that you should simply ignore? Should all air conditioning issues be offered equal priority, or are some problems much more urgent than others? Fortunately, the HVAC experts at G & S Heating Cooling & Electric are here to respond to all of your a/c repair questions. Let's begin with the advantages of hiring an expert to look after your AC repair.<p>
