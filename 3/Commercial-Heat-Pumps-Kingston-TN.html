<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items provide a danger just when they are dealt with in a way that produces dust containing asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing products are damaged or disturbed by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become air-borne if correct controls are not in place. This can lead to the potential for considerable illness.<p>
