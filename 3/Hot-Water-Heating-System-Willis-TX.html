<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

<p>Heatpump are a dream come true for folks in Seattle. A/c is something that most Seattleites will only use sparingly, but since heatpump can offer both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the very best of both worlds!

<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors.

The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area.
