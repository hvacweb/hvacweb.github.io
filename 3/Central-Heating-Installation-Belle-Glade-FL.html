<p>If you set it too low, you're encouraging the growth of mold in wet air. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold growth and pollution. Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of germs and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do.

Also, clean ducts and correct air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the needed equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still required to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>
