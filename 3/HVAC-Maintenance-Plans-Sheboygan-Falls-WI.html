<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the unit has been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
