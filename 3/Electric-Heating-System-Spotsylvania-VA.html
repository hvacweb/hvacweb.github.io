<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning an organisation was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end objective. HVAC company owner need to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
