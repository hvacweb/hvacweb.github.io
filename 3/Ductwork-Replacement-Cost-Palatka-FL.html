<h3>Baseboard Heaters in Palatka FL 32177</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
