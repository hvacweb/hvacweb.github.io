<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>
