Furnaces that kick on often may be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
