<p>Simplify your services, earn more services revenue, and provide an amazing customer experience. To ensure the system you choose is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load computation estimate to identify the precise type of heat and air conditioning system that's ideal for your home-we don't just change it with the same size unit you currently have. These calculations take into consideration things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is important so the system isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance visits per year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and typically some other advantages. Some companies use top priority consultations to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
