<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Woodbridge CT 06525</h3>
<p>I have been using them for many years for my companies, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He assisted me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again. He is truthful, trusted, and affordable on rate. It's hard to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
