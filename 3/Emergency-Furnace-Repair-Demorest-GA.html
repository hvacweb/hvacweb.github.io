<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system.

When the air conditioning system works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely useful in collecting info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to briefly deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
<p>Many AC systems include a variety of special features that can further improve performance and efficiency.
