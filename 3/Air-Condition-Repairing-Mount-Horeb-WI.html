Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them until they have actually been correctly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
