<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract tries to upsell you each time they come to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was 6 months prior to the existing one expired. She didn't require a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
