<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, considering that some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior.
