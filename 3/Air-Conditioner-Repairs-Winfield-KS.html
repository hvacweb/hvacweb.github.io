<p>Similar to most house enhancement jobs, the cost of a full central heating system can vary extensively based on the size of the home. Many heaters will last between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, homeowner should consider heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A little house, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too quickly and shut off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
