<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Cortland Ohio</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor ecological quality") describes how within air can affect a person's health, comfort, and ability to work.

Currently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements but it does provide guidelines about the most typical IAQ work environment problems.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
