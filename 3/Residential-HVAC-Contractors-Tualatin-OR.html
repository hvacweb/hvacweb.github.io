And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

The copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to provide enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
