In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary ecological danger to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was understood how harmful lead might be, it was utilized in paint, gasoline, pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
<p>The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends on a number of elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential influences. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a toxin depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which differs tremendously from person to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical toxins also.<p>
