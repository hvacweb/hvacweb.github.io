While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, given that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
