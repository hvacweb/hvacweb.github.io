<p>Another approach to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside. Many home heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate pollutants directly from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
