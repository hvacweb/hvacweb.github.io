<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
