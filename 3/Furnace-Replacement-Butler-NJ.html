<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary environmental threat to the health of kids in the United States." There are lots of ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was understood how damaging lead might be, it was utilized in paint, gas, water pipes, and lots of other items.<p>
