<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
