<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Romeoville IL</h3>
<p>The icing issue ends up being a lot more severe with lower outside temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional type of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used rather of the heatpump throughout harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
