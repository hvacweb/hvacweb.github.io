<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
