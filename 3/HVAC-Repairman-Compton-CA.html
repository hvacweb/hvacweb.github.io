<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold accumulation, states Dr. Khatri.

<p>The primary health effect connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
