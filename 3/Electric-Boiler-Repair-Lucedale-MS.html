Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater.
