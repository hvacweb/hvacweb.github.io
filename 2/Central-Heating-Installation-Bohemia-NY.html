<p>We look at ideas before we offer advice to replace rather than repair a heater. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
