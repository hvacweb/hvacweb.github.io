Hazardous direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is poorly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
