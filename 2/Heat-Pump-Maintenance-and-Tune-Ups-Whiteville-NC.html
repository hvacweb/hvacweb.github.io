<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
