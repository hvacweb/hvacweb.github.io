They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to buy it. My other half said that she had seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most good people I have fulfilled in a long time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the genuine individuals who are there for us.
