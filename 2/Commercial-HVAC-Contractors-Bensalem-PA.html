<p>The primary reason property owners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the amount of services provided. The cost might not be rewarding if the system is new and still under a maker's warranty. Any major repairs ought to be covered under the producer's guarantee.

<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
