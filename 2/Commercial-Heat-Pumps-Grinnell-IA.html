<h3>Designing Tips for Central Heating Systems in Grinnell IA</h3>

Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
