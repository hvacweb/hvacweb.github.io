<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Highland MI</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house construction is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofs. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>I extremely recommend using this service. Really dependable extremely great.

I am currently on the maintance plan. He looks after it two times a year with out needing to be reminded to do it.<p>
