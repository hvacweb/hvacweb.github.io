<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Coarsegold CA?</h3>
<p>Most people are aware that outdoor air pollution can affect their health, however indoor air contamination can also have significant, hazardous effect. EPA studies of human direct exposure to air pollutants show that indoor levels of pollutants might be 2 to five times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air contamination amongst the top five ecological health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
