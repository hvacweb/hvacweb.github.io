<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, a number of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Gas heaters do feature some disadvantages. The greatest drawback is also the result of the combustion procedure. This procedure releases exhaust gases, consisting of carbon monoxide gas, which have to be vented to the outside of the home. Carbon monoxide gas is an odorless gas, and is extremely toxic in higher concentrations. Because of this, a malfunctioning gas furnace or a venting issue might put your house's residents in real risk. It is exceptionally important to have your gas furnace regularly serviced, and to ensure your home has a carbon monoxide gas alarm set up.<p>

If you still can not find out why your furnace keeps running, contact a knowledgeable technician.<p>

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very handy in collecting details on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
<p>Normally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions.
