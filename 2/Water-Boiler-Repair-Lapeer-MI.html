<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit increase. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
