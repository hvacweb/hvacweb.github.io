<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Utilize or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common approach of reducing direct exposure to indoor air pollutants, likewise will decrease but not eliminate direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke.

In addition, the large boosts in ventilation it requires to considerably reduce exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses substantially.
