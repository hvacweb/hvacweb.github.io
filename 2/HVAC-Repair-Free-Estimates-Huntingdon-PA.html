<h3>Heating Company in Huntingdon Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was extremely happy they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>

<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Huntingdon PA 16652</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
