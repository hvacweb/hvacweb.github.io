<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years ago and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>

The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
