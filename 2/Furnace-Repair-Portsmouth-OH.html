<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>There are lots of actions a homeowner can take to choose items that will avoid indoor air problems from taking place - a couple of them are discussed here. First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, think about utilizing solid wood products. Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make certain that an effective wetness barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet.
