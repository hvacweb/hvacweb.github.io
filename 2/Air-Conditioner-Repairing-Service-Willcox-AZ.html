<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Construction and Commissioning is designed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure materials, cigarette smoking, household products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in made products.

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions because they don't need any new ductwork to be set up. Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each room or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
