<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
