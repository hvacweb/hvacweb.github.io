Goodrich's daddy was a Goettl dealership in Las Vegas, so when the opportunity came to buy what was left of the firm in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heater, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
