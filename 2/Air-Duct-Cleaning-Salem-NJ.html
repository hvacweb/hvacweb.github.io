<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
