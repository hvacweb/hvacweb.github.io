The typical summer season temperature to come to the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the correct SEER rating for your area, deduct 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83.

<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
