<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold development and moisture inside your home is connected with a greater occurrence of occupant respiratory problems.<p>
<p>Outside contaminants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Professionals advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and usually are better for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>

<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system.
