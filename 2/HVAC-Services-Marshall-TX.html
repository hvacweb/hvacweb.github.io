<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally brought on by the absence of appropriate ventilation, which leads to a buildup of contaminants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in over half the office indoor air investigations it has carried out. Examinations performed in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually discovered the very same to be true. These examinations exposed that proper ventilation is important in maintaining great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big commercial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and medical facilities, vehicles such as cars, trains, planes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are managed with regard to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Typically the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is likewise a more cost-effective method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>

To prevent CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
