<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it tires warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any airflow constraint will lower the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial influences.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
