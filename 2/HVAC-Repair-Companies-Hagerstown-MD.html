<p>My eldest kid always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
