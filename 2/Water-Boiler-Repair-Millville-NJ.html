<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having solved the issue with a simple repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part.

His time and knowledge to FIX the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a somewhat unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like an area heating unit) with the very same quantity of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
