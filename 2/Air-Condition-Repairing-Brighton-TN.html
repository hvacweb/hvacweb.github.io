<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
