<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for many years.

<p>For whole house setups, it's hard, if nearly difficult, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing house, especially a hydronic system.

This is a lot more affordable on a smaller sized scale. Bigger restorations like additions to a home may appropriate for a bigger scale and more expensive hydronic system.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not provide them.  Second of all like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the unit has been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years.
