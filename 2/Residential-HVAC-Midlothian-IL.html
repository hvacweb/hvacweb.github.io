<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Health Problem (BRI) describes less regular (but typically more serious) cases of people ending up being ill after being in a specific structure at a specific time. In these cases, there is typically a comparable set of clinical signs experienced by the individuals and a clear cause can typically be discovered upon investigation. Legionnaires Disease is an example of BRI brought on by bacteria which can pollute a building's a/c system.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, a professional service person must be called for nearly any maintenance other than regular cleaning. Central air conditioning conditioners ought to be professionally checked and changed before the beginning of every cooling season. Nevertheless, don't let your maintenance end with this yearly examination. While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system operating at peak efficiency.<p>
<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Midlothian Illinois</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>We're investing a lot more time inside your home, these days. While lots of people assume contamination is simply an outside problem, your home (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we don't believe sufficient about exposure to all the things we put in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a big impact on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- immediately, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe simpler.<p>
<p>Whether your air conditioning system has actually stopped blowing cool air or it makes strange sounds, call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric for a professional evaluation. The earlier you call for HVAC repair, the faster you'll have the ability to get your cooling system up and running. So don't wait.
