<p>The most underrated HVAC part in your air conditioning system is the evaporator & condenser coil. The majority of people believe the compressor is the only component that matters when making a huge HVAC decision on replacing your equipment. Many cooling replacements occur when the emergency ac repair Houston Heights 77007 77008 is with your coils, not your compressor. Refrigerant leaks occur when the copper or aluminum coils begin to rust.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
