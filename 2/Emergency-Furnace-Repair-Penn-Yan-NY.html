Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
