<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for people who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have respiratory issues, winter season can exacerbate problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, family pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too cold to toss open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it is necessary to be familiar with a few of the allergy and breathing triggers that might be lurking in your surroundings.<p>

Those processes include bringing in outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
