<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services in Rosamond CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
