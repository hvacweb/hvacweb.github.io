<p>Indoor environments are extremely intricate and structure residents may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the kind of particles and gases) from office devices, cleaning items, building and construction home furnishings, activities and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outside contaminants.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
