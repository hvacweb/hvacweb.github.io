This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
