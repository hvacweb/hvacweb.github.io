<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperature levels in Seattle are acceptably typical, you can anticipate a minimum of thirty days throughout which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 last year! Just a couple of years ago, Seattle saw a record temperature of 103 degrees, and there have actually been lots of long, dry, hot streaks ever since.

<p>When you invest in a brand-new heating and cooling system, you're investing in your house, your household, and your company. You deserve to understand who will show up, how they will look, and have confidence in the company you have actually employed. We hear all the time about sketchy automobiles showing up with people who can't communicate well, aren't expert, and leaves you questioning what you just spent your money on.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new homes are beginning to feature mechanical systems that bring outside air into the house. A few of these styles consist of energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also referred to as air-to-air heat exchangers). To learn more about air-to-air heat exchangers, get in touch with the Preservation and Renewable Resource Inquiry and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
