Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, along with all other types of heat pumps, have effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE.
