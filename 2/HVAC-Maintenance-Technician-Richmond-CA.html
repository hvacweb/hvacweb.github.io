<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
