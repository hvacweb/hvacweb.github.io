<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Camilla GA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, earlier this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
