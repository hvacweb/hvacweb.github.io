<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Manchester Kentucky</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was type of strange being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with concerns. I would suggest this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
