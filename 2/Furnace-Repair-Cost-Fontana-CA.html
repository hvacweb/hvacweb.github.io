<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location 2 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, a professional service individual need to be called for practically any maintenance aside from regular cleaning. Central air conditioning conditioners need to be expertly examined and changed before the start of every cooling season. Nevertheless, do not let your maintenance end with this yearly checkup. While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system running at peak efficiency.<p>

<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult task that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.
