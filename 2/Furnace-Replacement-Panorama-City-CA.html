<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has ended up being an important issue to house owners and health specialists.

Appropriate ventilation and removal of the sources of these pollutants are important in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as near the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
