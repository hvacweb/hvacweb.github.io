<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
