<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>

<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could flatter twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed simply a few years earlier.<p>
<p>Before setting up any new heating or cooling system in a house, it is necessary to re evaluate and reduce the energy load of the home. A more energy efficient home will not only minimize the cost of a new system and energy costs, but it will significantly improve the comfort of your house. Before we style and set up any systems, we arrange a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Standard improvements usually include adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can recommend several competent house Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact Us for recommendations.<p>
