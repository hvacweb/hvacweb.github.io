After two years, things started to alter. There have been awkward noises. I got it examined and repaired. I am hoping that is completion of the issue. Overall, it has been a good experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Neat operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the start. But then recognized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>I have actually ended up being fairly proficient at looking into items on line prior to purchasing them.

Since they are really taxed in the summer, because I live in FL it is vital to have an excellent AC unit in your house.<p>
