<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He assisted me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is truthful, reputable, and affordable on price. It's hard to find a truthful AC man and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Devices costs are driven by the kind of furnace at the heart of your home heater. Low-efficiency models will cost less, but lead to higher energy costs. High-efficiency designs cost more, but save more over the long run. Prices for gas furnaces range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models as much as $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric heating systems begin at $395 and range as much as $1,700 or more depending upon the brand name and furnace size.<p>
<p>The primary factor property owners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the quantity of services used. If the system is brand-new and still under a producer's warranty, the cost may not be worthwhile. Any major repairs need to be covered under the manufacturer's guarantee.
