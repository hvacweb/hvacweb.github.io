<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and cure-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
