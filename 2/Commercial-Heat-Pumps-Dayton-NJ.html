<p>Making use of air filters can trap a few of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable Energy area suggests that "Air Filtration need to have a Minimum Performance Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to minimize the quantity of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can function as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can lower the efficiency of the coils.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up just a few years ago.<p>
<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While room a/c provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is typically more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
