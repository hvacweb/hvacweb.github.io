<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Switched to utilizing Wachoff's about a year back and they've been to the house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced reasonably, have dealt with the one repair I required well, and are professional and constantly on-time.

<p>The first ac system and fridges used poisonous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
