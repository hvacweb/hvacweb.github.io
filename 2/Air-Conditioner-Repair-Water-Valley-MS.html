The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the same period. Basically, SEER offers more information based on how the EER performs in various temps. The higher the system's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all home appliances.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
