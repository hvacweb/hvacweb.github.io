<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
