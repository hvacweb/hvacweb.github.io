<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence occupants. Unlike other types of a/c unit, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be allowed to press the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to keep and understand.<p>
