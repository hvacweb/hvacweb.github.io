You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the chances are good that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's finest to change the capacitor.<p>
