<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
