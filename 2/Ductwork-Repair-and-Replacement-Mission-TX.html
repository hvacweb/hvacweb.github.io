<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

<h3>Install New Air Conditioner in Mission TX 78572</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
