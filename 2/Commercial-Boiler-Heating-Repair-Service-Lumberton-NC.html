<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Employ experts and treat them well: Encouraged, well-compensated specialists perform better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. Since they're inexpensive, an ethical company doesn't exploit low-cost labor chances just. Low-cost craftsmanship is normally substandard workmanship, and it never assists a company construct long-lasting relationships with customers.<p>
