<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
