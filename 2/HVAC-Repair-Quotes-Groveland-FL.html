<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
