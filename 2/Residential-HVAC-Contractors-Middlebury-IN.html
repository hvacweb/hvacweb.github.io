<h3>What to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Middlebury IN</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
