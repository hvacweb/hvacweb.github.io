<h3>AC Service in Rutland MA 01543</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large retailer who asked not to be named due to the fact that he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a team that consistently monitors energy intake and temperature levels in shops to minimize costs (particularly during the night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the shops change beyond an acceptable range that might prevent customers from shopping at the shop.<p>

<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out troubleshooting the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
