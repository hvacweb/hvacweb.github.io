<p>Some HVAC specialists offer service agreements to their clients, offering regular maintenance of heating and cooling systems. In some instances, other tradespeople will work with HVAC techs to assist set up or repair cooling and heating systems.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
