<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
