<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location 2 2x4s below the box to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioners and fridges utilized toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
