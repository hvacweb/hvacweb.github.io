<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known fact that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as important as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will frequently build up in ductwork, restricting air flow.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 should be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements.

<p>Over the past few years, there has actually been some publicity recommending that houseplants have been revealed to reduce levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is presently no proof, however, that a reasonable number of houseplants get rid of significant quantities of pollutants in workplaces and homes.
