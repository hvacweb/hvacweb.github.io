<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold.

The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>Central Heating Installation Service in Sebastopol CA</h3>
<p>One of the primary factors a furnace will run constantly is since something is unclean or clogged up Prior to attempting to repair any issue, take time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". Inspect the furnace blower for clogging and clean it if the air filter is excellent to go. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it if this does not work. If you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running, call a knowledgeable technician.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
