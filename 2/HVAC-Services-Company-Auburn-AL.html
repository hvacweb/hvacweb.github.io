<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a properly sized system. Since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system does not lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
