<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized.

Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
