<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps usually require excavation to install, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>

There is presently no proof, nevertheless, that a sensible number of houseplants get rid of considerable quantities of pollutants in offices and homes. Since overly moist soil might promote the growth of microbes which can impact allergic individuals, indoor houseplants should not be over-watered.<p>
