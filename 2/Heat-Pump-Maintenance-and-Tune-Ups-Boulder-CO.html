<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding sounds. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler typically happen.

<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>Often, indoor air quality issues in big commercial structures can not be effectively recognized or remedied without a detailed building examination. These investigations might begin with composed surveys and telephone assessments in which building detectives assess the history of resident symptoms and building operation treatments.
