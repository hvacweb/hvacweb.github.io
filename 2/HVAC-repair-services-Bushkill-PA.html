<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
