<p>If your a/c unit is more than eight years old, repair is most likely not worth the expense, unless it's a simple problem like debris clogging the condenser unit or a worn fan belt.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>You should constantly employ a professional to perform AC repair, for the very same reason that you rely on a professional plumbing technician or electrician. You do not conduct repairs on your own pipes system, or replace your own electrical grid. The factors that you do not do those things are obvious. You don't have the tools, or the expertise, to be sure that you perform those procedures securely and properly. Professionals, however, do have the tools and expertise to do the job properly. Cooling repair is no different. You always want to employ an expert to repair your system, so you can have the peace of mind associated trusting a professional in the field.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might see unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, talk to your physician about them. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
