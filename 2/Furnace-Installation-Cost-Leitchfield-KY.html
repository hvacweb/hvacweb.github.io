<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. When the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively harden and treat-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
