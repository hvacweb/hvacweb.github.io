<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
