Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
