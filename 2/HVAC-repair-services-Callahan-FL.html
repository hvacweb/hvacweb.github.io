<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
