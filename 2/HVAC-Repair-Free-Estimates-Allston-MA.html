The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the primary problem in over half the workplace indoor air investigations it has performed.

These examinations revealed that proper ventilation is very important in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>

In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also produce particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
