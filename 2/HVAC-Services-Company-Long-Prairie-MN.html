<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, see Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
