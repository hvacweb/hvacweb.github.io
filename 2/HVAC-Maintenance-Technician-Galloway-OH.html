<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller house, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your house via ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
