<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous.
