<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from building up on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m actually fussy with my things. I like my equipment and appliances initial, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with low-cost knock-offs. So purchasing this ac system to change my old one was rather of a tough reality. You canâ $ t trust the commercial these days. Am grateful I got this however because it has restored my faith in good manufacturing. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this new Carrier I got because I bought it 7 months back. Itâ $ s just perfect.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
