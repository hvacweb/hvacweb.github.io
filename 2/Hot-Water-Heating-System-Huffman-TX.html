Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>

He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead.

<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
