The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
