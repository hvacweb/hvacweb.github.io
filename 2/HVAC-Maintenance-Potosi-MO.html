<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most economical. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Air pollutants can range from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a typical air contaminant arising from natural gas that escapes into your home without being burnt. Older homes might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchens and restrooms, mold and mildew can become a problem where moisture levels are typically greater than in the rest of your home.<p>

According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those processes include bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
