Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
