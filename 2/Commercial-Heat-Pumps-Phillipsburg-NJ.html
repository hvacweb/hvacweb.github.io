<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Filthy Filters: â $ " Â Filters blocked with dust, family pet hair and other particles lead to issues like failure to offer appropriate heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time. If you find the problem and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. Do It Yourself filter replacement choices range from $3 to $40, and you get what you pay for. That may be a really pricey dirty-filter medical diagnosis if the technician comes to your home. This kind of cleaning work must be performed in a routine basis, so a furnace tune-up is needed, examine our Furnace Tune-Up Cost Guide to see its cost.<p>
