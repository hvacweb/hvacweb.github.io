<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. The probability of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon several elements including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether a person reacts to a toxin depends upon specific sensitivity, which varies greatly from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for distributing hot and cold air throughout your house, supplying a comfortable environment in every space. But ducts that are not set up effectively or preserved can distribute contaminants from one room to another. In time, dust, dander and even mold can collect in your ducts, decreasing the overall air quality. Hire an expert to make certain your ducts are distributing fresh, tidy air.<p>

<p>Homeowners might also assume that since a glowing flooring heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a house improvement, its installation will immediately raise their home's value. No evidence exists recommending that in-floor heating either positively or negatively impacts property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Value Report issued by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Renovation Magazine. Maybe Realtors must consider too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heat system might add to, or deduct from, any provided asking price. That stated, homebuyers aiming to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heater will be willing to pay a premium for a house that includes one.<p>
