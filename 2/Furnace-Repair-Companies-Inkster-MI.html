<p>Many people are becoming more worried and mindful about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt consisting of contaminants and irritants can cover the a/c ductwork with time. Occasionally it must be eliminated to improve and revitalize the quality of indoor air and improve the cooling. Beacon Pipes, Seattle, WA cleans the air ducts physically by getting rid of the particles from the air filter.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
