Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of permitting heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes.
