<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).
