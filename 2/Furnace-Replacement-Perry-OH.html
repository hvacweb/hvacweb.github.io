<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
