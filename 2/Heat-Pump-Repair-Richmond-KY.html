<p>Oil furnaces tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be appropriately vented and cleaned from the furnace routinely.

<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most cost effective if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
