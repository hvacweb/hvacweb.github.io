<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
