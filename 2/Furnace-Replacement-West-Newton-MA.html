<p>Factors that can contribute to the development of biological impurities are wet or damp structure products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and improperly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common health problem triggered by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Various fungi and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are animals and family plants.<p>
<p>Check these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
