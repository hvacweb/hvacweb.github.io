<h3>Picking the Right Business For Heating and AC Systems at Green Bay WI</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
