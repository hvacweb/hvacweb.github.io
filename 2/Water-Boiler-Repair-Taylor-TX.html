It takes extremely little time to heat up or cool off your house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had before. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
