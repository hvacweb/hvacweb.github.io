<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>If no impurity sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not adequate to account for a boost in the number of employees in the location, stale air may also be a problem.<p>

<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is allowed to flow and increase out high structure openings to the outdoors (stack effect ), triggering cool outdoors air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation plans can utilize really little energy, but care must be taken to ensure comfort. In warm or damp environments, maintaining thermal convenience entirely via natural ventilation may not be possible. Cooling systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also utilize outside air to condition spaces, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and disperse cool outdoor air when appropriate.<p>
