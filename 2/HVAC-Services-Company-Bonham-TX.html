<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
