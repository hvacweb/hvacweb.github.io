An air pollutant could likewise originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care products.
