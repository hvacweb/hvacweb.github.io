Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the very same time, since the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not easy, considering that it takes into account not only the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

When the air conditioning system works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
