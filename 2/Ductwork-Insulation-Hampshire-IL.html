<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>
