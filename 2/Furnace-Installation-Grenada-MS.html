<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to offer enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
