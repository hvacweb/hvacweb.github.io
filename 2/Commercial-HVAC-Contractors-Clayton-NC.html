<p>Some health results might appear soon after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a pollutant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate results are generally short-term and treatable.

Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these diseases do disappoint up until many years after direct exposure began. The majority of people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some developed disease from exposure to clothing and devices brought house from task sites.<p>

<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may notice undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
