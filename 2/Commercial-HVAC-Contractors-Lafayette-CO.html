<p>Remember that the SEER score is determined using the exact same set of temperatures across the board.

<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area.

Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
