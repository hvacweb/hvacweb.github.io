<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same.

Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and treat-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
