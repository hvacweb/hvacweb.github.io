As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
