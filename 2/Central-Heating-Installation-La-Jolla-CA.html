<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

If your system is near, or past, its anticipated lifespan, replacement might be the most economical solution.<p>
