<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled.
