<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health results mentioned. However, it is not always true that the impacts noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically found in the home. In many cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health impacts is too restricted to determine the levels at which the listed effects might happen.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can range from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your animals to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air pollutant resulting from gas that escapes into your house without being burnt. Older houses may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where wetness levels are generally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
