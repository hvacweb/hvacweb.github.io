<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
