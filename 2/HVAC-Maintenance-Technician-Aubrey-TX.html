<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Often times, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally just readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best choice for property owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
