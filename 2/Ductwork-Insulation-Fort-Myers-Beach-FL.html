In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Many elements affect IAQ. These aspects include bad ventilation (lack of outside air), problems managing temperature level, high or low humidity, current remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air entering into the building. Sometimes, particular contaminants like dust from building and construction or renovation, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals released as a gas in time) may cause poor IAQ.<p>
