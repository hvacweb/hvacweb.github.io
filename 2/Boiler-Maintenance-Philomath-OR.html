I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense.

He helped me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to discover an honest AC person and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
