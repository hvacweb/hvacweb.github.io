<p>The main factor house owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the quantity of services used. The cost might not be worthwhile if the system is brand-new and still under a maker's guarantee. Any significant repairs should be covered under the manufacturer's warranty.

<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
