The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
