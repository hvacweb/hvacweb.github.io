<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Ensure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
