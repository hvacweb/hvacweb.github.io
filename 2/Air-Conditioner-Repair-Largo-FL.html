<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
