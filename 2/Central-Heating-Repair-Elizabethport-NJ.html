<p>The toxins noted in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health results mentioned. However, it is not necessarily true that the effects noted take place at the pollutant concentration levels normally discovered in the home. In a lot of cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health effects is too limited to figure out the levels at which the listed impacts could happen.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
