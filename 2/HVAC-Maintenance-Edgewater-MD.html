<p>Check these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
