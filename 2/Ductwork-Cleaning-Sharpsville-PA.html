Toxins might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon going into the house from the ground listed below. An air toxin could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or individual care products.
