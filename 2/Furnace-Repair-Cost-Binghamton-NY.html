<p>Make sure there are no rugs, furniture, or anything else limiting the circulation of air. Not just will blocked vents and signs up impact your convenience, they can also lead to duct leaks due to extreme atmospheric pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused spaces is NOT an excellent idea. You won't save any money and will end up triggering more issues for your heater.<p>
<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are delicate to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter season can worsen problems. Stale indoor air and heating unit can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, family pet dander, and mold spores circulating through your home. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too chilly to toss open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is very important to be aware of some of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that may be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence.

(Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
