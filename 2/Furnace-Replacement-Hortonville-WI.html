<p>If your air conditioning unit is more than 8 years old, repair is most likely not worth the expense, unless it's a simple issue like debris obstructing the condenser system or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to evaluate not just the condition of your existing equipment, but also the ducts that deliver the cool air and the general quality of the insulation in your home.
