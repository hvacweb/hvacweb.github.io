<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or changing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of wetness, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of undesirable smells and excessive wetness, presents outside air, keeps interior building air circulating, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
