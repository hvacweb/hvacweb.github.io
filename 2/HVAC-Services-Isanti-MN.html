<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning an organisation was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't completion goal.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
