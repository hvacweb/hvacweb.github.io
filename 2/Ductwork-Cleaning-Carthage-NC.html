<p>Designed to improve producing procedure control in a printing plant, Provider's innovation managed not just temperature but also humidity Carrier used his understanding of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the procedure. Rather of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thus the quantity of moisture in the air could be managed, which in turn made the humidity in the space controllable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped preserve constant paper dimensions and ink positioning. Later, Carrier's innovation was used to increase performance in the workplace, and The Provider Air Conditioning Company of America was formed to satisfy rising need. In time, a/c came to be utilized to enhance comfort in houses and automobiles too.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
