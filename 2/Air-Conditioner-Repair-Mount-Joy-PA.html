<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
