<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Port Jefferson NY</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in house building and construction is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in floors, roofs, and walls. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical technique of reducing exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will minimize however not eliminate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Due to the fact that smoking produces such big amounts of contaminants, natural or mechanical ventilation strategies do not eliminate them from the air in your home as quickly as they build up. In addition, the large increases in ventilation it requires to substantially decrease exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs significantly. As a result, the most reliable method to reduce exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the house is to get rid of smoking there.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
