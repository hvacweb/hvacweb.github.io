What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
