<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
