Most owners stick with the larger firms after acquisition. In some cases, the acquisition supplies a way for the seller to retire and make certain employees are taken care of. For the a lot of part, the getting companies want the owner to stay. Reedy chooses the owners remain on and reinvest a portion of their equity from the sale back into the company, although this isn't a requirement.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
