<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a regular oil modification in your automobile.

In addition, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter once every 3 months. During high use months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>

The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>We take a look at hints prior to we provide guidance to change rather than repair a heating unit. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
