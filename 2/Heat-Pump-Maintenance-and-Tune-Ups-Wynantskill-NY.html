<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the technique is described as radiant heating.<p>
