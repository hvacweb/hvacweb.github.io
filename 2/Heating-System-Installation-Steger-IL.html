Numerous typical structure materials utilized before 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Generally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure products are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling.

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
