<p>A geothermal heating unit does not produce its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, coal, or gas. Rather, it absorbs heat from within the earth.

This makes a geothermal heating system an appealing option to cut your carbon footprint, providing a favorable impact on the environment.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as a cars and truck radiator or typical household ac system does.
