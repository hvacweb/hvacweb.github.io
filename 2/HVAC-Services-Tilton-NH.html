<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for people who are delicate to indoor irritants or have respiratory problems, winter season can worsen problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores distributing through your house.
