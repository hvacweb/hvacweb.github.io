<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a referral in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
