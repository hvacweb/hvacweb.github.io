<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, considering that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

Such a tool needs to recognize the number of individuals impacted; specify ages and task descriptions of involved employees; identify where they are located within the workplace; suggest when the symptoms occur (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of particular health signs or diseases; recognize all makers run in the work environment; indicate the kind of outside air pollution; and recognize potential sources of job tension.<p>
