<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.  Secondly like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to correctly service and the system has been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
