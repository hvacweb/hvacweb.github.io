<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, considering that some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior.
