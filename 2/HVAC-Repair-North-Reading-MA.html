<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
