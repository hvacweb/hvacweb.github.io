Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
