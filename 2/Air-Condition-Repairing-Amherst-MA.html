<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
