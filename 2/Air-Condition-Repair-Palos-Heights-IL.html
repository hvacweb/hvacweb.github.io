<h3>Types of HVAC Repairs in Palos Heights IL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Many factors affect IAQ. These elements include bad ventilation (lack of outside air), problems managing temperature level, high or low humidity, recent renovation, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering into the structure.
