In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
