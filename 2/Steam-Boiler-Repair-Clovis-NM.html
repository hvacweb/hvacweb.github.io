<p>There are a couple of main things that property owners will wish to think about when deciding which of the best AC systems they need to set up in their houses. It really depends upon what you value the most in a top brand name central air conditioner. The significant factors for many homeowners will be the total cost to install the best air conditioner brands, life expectancy of the AC system, guarantees offered, energy effectiveness (SEER scores), and size of the system you need for your house's square video footage (LOTS) to efficiently cool your home.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
