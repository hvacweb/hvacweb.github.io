<p>When mounting a wall sensor, consider the height at which they should be positioned. A lot of typically they are mounted at height-level or somewhat lower, if people mostly remain seated in that specific area. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the flooring or ceiling; depending upon what contaminant you're trying to track you'll need to position the sensor appropriately.

<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was very comprehensive and on-time in explaining what services would be carried out. Also Camryn offered excellent client service at the end of the appointment by explaining exactly what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance tasks we might want to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics utilized by some in the industry.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>As pointed out above, triggering your new under tile floor heater prematurely, before the mortar has treated, can cause the grout to break or to not adhere appropriately, and may void the guarantee of your mortar item. In some testing, even the tile split when the system was run prior to the substance had cured. And mortar manufacturers may refuse guarantee coverage if you do not follow their guidelines.<p>
