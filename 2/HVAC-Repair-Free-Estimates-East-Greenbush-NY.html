<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
