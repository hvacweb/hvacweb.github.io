<p>Outside contaminants. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and irritants found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Experts recommend using filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and usually are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in Columbia TN 38401</h3>
<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " primary environmental hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, weakening paint, and dust. When a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead goes into the body. Before it was known how harmful lead could be, it was utilized in paint, gasoline, pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, a number of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
