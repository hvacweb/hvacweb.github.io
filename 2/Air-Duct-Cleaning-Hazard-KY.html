<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil.
