<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
