<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ¬∞ C (40-55 ¬∞ F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
