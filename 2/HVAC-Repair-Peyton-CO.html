<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
