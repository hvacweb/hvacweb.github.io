<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heating unit, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable principles.

As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
