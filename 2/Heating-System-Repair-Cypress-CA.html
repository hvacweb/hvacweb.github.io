<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
