<p>A geothermal heating system does not create its power by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, or gas. Instead, it absorbs heat from within the earth. In addition, a geothermal cooling and heating system utilizes substantially less electrical energy compared to a basic electric heat-resistance heatpump. This makes a geothermal heater an attractive option to cut your carbon footprint, offering a positive influence on the environment.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
