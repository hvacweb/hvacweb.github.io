<p>Particular instant impacts resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically difficult to identify if the symptoms are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is very important to take notice of the time and place the symptoms occur. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort must be made to determine indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
