<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>HVAC Duct Repair in Windsor Mill MD 21244</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
