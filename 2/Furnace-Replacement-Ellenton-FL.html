<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power needs to not exceed the capability of the outside system.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems at Ellenton FL</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window package units, are geared up with internal air filters.

Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
