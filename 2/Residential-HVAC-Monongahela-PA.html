<p>Professional heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists advise following this basic rule when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
