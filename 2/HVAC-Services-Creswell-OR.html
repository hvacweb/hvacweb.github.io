<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send the sensor data to the cloud, where you can access it through software. You get immediate, real-time access to the tracking results through a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to analyze.<p>
