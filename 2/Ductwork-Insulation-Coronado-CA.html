<h3>Designing Tips to Central Heating Systems in Coronado CA</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>In general, repair and renovation activities in owner occupied housing systems are not subject to particular policies associated with the management of lead.

<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S).

Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
