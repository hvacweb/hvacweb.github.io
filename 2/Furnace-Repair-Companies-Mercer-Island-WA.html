<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product gradually.

Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
