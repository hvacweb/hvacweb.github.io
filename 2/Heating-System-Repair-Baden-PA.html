<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known truth that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will often build up in ductwork, restricting air flow.

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
