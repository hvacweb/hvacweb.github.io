<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up.
