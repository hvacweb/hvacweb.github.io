<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
