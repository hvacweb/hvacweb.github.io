<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
