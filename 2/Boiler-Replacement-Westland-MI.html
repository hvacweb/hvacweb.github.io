<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Function in Westland MI?</h3>
<p>MAINTENANCE PLANS: Your HVAC system is a financial investment that spends for itself throughout the years, but only if you safeguard it to the very best of your ability. Fortunately, this does not have to be a task! We take care of everything when you sign up for a Keefe's maintenance strategy. No matter what make or design of cooling or heating system you own, even if it's a zone control system, you'll get semi-annual examinations, discounted diagnostics, concern service, and incredible offers on replacements and repairs. Choose in between our bronze, platinum, gold, and silver plans, and we'll offer you with the highest level of security and maintenance.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
