There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
