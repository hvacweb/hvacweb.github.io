<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They include delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Kids, fetuses, and infants are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups given that lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead. Kids might have higher exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
