As an initial step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts years, considering that it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
