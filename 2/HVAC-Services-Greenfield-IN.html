<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Radiant heat offers a variety of unique advantages over forced air heating systems. For example, radiant heating systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They do not need to stress over duct leaks, which are responsible for output losses of as much as 30% in other heating unit types. Transmitting heat through strong items will likewise cause it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium. A home heated up by a glowing system will heat up faster, and stay warm with less energy invested. These are just a few of the many advantages that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>
