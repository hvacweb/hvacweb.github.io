<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
