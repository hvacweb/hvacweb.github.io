<p>Heaters are like cars and trucks. As they age, you can replace one part only need another part changed or repaired next year. It does not take long to invest $500 just to keep an old oil or natural gas furnace running. Heaters sustain the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion goal.
