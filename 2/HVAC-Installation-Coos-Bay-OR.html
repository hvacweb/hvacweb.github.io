The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>
