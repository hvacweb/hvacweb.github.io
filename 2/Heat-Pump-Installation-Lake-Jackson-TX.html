<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that perfect temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those typical air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service strategy which normally includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
