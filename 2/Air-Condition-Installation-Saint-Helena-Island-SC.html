<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Function in Saint Helena Island SC?</h3>
<p>One of the main factors a furnace will run constantly is since something is dirty or stopped up Prior to attempting to repair any problem, take some time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is great to go, examine the furnace blower for blocking and clean it. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it if this does not work. Contact a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
