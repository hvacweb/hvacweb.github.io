<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps at Chowchilla CA</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics recently, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
