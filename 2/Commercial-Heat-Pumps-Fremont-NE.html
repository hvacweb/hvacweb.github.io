<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
