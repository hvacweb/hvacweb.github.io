<h3>Picking the Proper Business For Heating and AC Systems at West Valley City UT</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely pleased that someone as experienced as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to test the air conditioner prior to you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>We take a look at hints prior to we provide recommendations to replace instead of repair a heater. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy.
