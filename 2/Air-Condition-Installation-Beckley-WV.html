<p>The compressor can shut and get too hot down if the condenser coils are clogged. You'll experience periodic durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them again. Turn off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still does not work appropriately after you've cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work fully unless you do this.<p>

Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
