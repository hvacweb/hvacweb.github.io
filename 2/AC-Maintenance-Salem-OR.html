<p>Biological pollutants: the biological pollutants can include germs, infections, fungi (mold), allergen irritant, animal dander, insect bio sediment, fibers and fiberglass, pollen, cockroach allergen, etc. and may arise from insufficient maintenance and house cleaning, water spills, inadequate humidity control, condensation, or might be brought into the building by residents, seepage, or ventilation air.

<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Because it just takes more electricity to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
