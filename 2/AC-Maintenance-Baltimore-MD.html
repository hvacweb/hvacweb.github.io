<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
