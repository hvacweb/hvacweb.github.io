<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps at Griffin GA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We decided on getting something more expensive than a conventional water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>

<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Griffin GA 30223</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m actually choosy with my things. I like my equipment and home appliances original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with low-cost knock-offs. So buying this air conditioning system to replace my old one was somewhat of a tough fact. You canâ $ t trust the commercial nowadays. Am pleased I got this however due to the fact that it has actually restored my faith in great production. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this new Carrier I got given that I purchased it 7 months back. Itâ $ s simply perfect.<p>
