A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of several rooms with one external system. In the outdoor unit of this ac system there is a more powerful compressor, ports for linking a number of traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor units found in the room.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>
