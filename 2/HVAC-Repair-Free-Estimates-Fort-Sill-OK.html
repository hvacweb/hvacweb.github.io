<p>We take a look at ideas before we offer recommendations to change rather than repair a heating system. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
