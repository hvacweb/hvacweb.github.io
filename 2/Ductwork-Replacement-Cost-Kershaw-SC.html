<p>Generally the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions.
