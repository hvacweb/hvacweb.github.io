<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in place. Additionally, the concrete results of a PM is typically tough to quantify, as one response stated the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the result of repetitive use of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, resulting in cracks and holes. , if that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.. a very advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
