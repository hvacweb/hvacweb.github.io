<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have several control panel. The largest, or just one in some heaters, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and manage of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control board must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
