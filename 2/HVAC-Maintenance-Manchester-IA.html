<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap.
