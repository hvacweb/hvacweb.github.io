PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While room a/c supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is generally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
