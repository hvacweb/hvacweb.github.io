<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has actually been utilized typically in a range of building construction materials for insulation and as a fire-retardant.

<p>Aspects that can add to the development of biological impurities are moist or wet building materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and badly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning system. "Humidifier fever" is a common illness caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Various fungis and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these impurities can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and household plants.<p>
