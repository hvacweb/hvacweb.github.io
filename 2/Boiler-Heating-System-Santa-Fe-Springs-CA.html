Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
