<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Kenedy TX</h3>
<p>Having a wood-burning heater can be very effective in terms of cost. If you have access to complimentary or cheap fire wood, or you cut your own wood from your timber, it might not cost you anything. Regrettably, wood-burning heating unit need a really crucial natural resource: wood! Due to the fact that of the amount of wood needed to properly heat your entire house, wood-burning heat systems may not be great for the environment in spite of being carbon neutral.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
