Throughout high usage months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>

Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
