Throughout high usage months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really practical in gathering information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
