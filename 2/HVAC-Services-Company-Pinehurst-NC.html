<p>The most typical kind of home heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or lp to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least pricey option, however more recent systems can be really energy effective.

<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those looking to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally just offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best alternative for property owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
