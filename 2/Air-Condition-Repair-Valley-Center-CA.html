<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often described as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floorings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioner to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers.
