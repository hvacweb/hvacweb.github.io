<p>The primary health result related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
