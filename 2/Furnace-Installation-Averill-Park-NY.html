<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, sometimes linked to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your home.
