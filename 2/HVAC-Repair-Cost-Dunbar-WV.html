<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
