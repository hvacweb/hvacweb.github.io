<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Many AC systems include a number of unique functions that can further improve efficiency and performance. For instance, house owners may wish to search for one that includes an integrated filter light that will signal you when the air filter needs to be altered. Another popular feature to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to decrease energy costs a lot more. Of course, more features suggest greater central air expenses.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heating unit appears less like a high-end product and more like a requirement. (Besides, warmed floorings were great enough for the Roman Empire) However before you dedicate to what can be a major remodeling job, it's finest to ask yourself whether a glowing flooring heating unit is an appropriate service for your specific house heating requirements.<p>
