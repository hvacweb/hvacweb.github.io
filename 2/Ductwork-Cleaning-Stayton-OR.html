<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance identify the efficiency of dilution.

There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this.

The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
