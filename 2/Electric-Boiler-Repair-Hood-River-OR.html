<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house.
