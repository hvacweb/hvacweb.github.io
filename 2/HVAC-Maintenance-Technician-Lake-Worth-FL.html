<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
