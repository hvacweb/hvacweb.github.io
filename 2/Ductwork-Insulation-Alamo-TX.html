<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might go into close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
