<h3>Ductwork Installation in Hawthorne CA 90250</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
