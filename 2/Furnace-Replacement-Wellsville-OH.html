<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " number one environmental threat to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled.
