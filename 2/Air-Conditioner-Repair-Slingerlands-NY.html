<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems at Slingerlands NY</h3>
<p>In the last several years, a growing body of scientific evidence has actually indicated that the air within houses and other structures can be more seriously contaminated than the outside air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Other research indicates that people invest approximately 90 percent of their time indoors. Therefore, for lots of people, the dangers to health may be higher due to exposure to air pollution inside than outdoors.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
