We have the experience and resources required to help from the preparation stages through to the final installation. We utilize the most recent software application to help design your ductwork system and use the greatest quality materials in the building and installation.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Make certain all the registers in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
