<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor.

<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.

Infected central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
