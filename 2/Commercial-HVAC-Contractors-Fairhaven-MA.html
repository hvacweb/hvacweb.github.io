<p>Unclean Filters: â $ " Â Filters clogged with dust, animal hair and other particles lead to issues like failure to supply sufficient heat, excess noise and the furnace running all the time. If you find the problem and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. Do It Yourself filter replacement options range from $3 to $40, and you get what you pay for.

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
