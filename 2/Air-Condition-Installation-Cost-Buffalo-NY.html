<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the prospective to adversely affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, germs, and extremely small particles of dust.

You get immediate, real-time access to the tracking results via a dashboard, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to figure out.<p>
