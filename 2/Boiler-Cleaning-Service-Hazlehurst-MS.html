While contaminants frequently discovered in indoor air can cause numerous hazardous results, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are required to produce particular health problems.

Further research is needed to better understand which health results occur after direct exposure to the typical contaminant concentrations found in houses and which happens from the higher concentrations that take place for brief amount of times.<p>
<p>I'll start with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion procedure. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>
