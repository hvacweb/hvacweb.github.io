<p>Central air systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely useful in gathering details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
