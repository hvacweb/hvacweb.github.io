Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling result.

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
