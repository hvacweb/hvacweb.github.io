<p>All heater have some level of air purification. From one of the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some basic maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne toxins flowing through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>The probability of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends upon individual sensitivity, which varies significantly from person to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical contaminants as well.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may discover undesirable or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, talk to your physician about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
