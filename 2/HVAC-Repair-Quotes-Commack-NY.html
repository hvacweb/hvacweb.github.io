Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion objective. HVAC entrepreneur ought to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
