This is usually used in a 2nd or third-floor  area and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>

<p>A/c can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
