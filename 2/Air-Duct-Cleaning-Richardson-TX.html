<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants released by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high indoors might cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in many buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as developing products, furnishings, and household items like air fresheners, release toxins basically constantly. Other sources, related to activities carried out in the home, release contaminants intermittently. These consist of smoking cigarettes, the use of malfunction-ing or unvented ranges, heating systems, or area heaters, making use of solvents in cleaning and hobby activities, the use of paint strippers in refurnishing activities, and making use of cleaning items and pesticides in housekeeping. High toxin concentrations can remain in the air for long periods after some of these activities.<p>
