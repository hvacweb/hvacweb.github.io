<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
