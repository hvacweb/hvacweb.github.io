<h3>Is Your Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Fanwood NJ?</h3>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
