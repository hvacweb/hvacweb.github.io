<p>Current Review: They were great! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my needs entirely by offering a professional quote with choices, without pushing extra items. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also promptly followed up with the necessary examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the proper replacement.
