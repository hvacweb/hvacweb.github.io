<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
