<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
<p>Old furnaces typically lack the ability to clean up the air and hydrate in your home. Your home air might feel stale or stuffy. Does anyone in your family experience allergic reactions to airborne dust, mold, pollen, infections or dander? Or does anybody experience dry nose, dry throat, or dry skin? Other signs may be frequent dust build-up, static shocks, drooping plants, furnishings splitting and musical instruments that do not stay in tune.
