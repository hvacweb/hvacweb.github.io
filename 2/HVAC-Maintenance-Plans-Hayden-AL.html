<p>Another alternative to oil heaters are gas furnaces While oil is traditionally used in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option between the two types. Gas furnaces cost about the very same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The real benefit of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, rather than the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
