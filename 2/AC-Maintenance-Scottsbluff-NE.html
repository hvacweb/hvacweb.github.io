<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise a choice for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these units contain not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost.
