Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
