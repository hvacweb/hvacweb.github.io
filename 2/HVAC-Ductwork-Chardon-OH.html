<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Chardon OH</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
