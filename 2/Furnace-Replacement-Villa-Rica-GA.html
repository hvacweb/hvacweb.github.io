<p>Pricing for furnace service and maintenance will differ commonly from dealership to dealer, for a variety of reasons.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a reference later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
