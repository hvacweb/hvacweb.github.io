<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
