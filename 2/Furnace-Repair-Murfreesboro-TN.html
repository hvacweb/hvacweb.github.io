<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the lack of adequate ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of contaminants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the primary issue in over half the work environment indoor air examinations it has actually conducted. Examinations conducted in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually discovered the exact same to be true. These examinations exposed that correct ventilation is necessary in maintaining excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently greater incomes for air conditioning tradesmen.

The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.
