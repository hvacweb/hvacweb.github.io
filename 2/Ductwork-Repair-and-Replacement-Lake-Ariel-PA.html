<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done.

<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you employ to install your central air system. In truth, you can even Do It Yourself, in spite of our strong recommendation not to do so. If you do take our suggestion, expect to pay between $300 and $1,000 in labor expenses to set up central air. Moreover, cooling contractors may charge an additional $50 to $200 for additional products and devices.<p>
<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical power to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
