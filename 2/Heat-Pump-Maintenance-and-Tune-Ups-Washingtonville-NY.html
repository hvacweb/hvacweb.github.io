<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ might discover moldy or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
