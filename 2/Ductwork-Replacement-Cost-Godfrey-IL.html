<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the abilities or tools needed to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still required to have a specialist technician check the system periodically.<p>

<p>After the system has actually been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
