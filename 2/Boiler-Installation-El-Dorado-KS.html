<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, since the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are typically just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
