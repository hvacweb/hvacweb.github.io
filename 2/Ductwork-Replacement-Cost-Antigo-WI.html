<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't offer contracts.  The so called credible companies rip off more people than the fly by night outfits.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
