<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their total power should not go beyond the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the rooms might not have a very comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not easy, given that it considers not only the small power of the units, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
