<h3>Furnace Repair Cost in Washington DC 20011</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>

Germs or micro-organisms might also exist within the ventilation system.
