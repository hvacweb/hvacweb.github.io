When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper.

When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy.
