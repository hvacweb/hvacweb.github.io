<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed.

Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains pipes, and sumps. When radon becomes trapped in buildings and concentrations build up inside, direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>
