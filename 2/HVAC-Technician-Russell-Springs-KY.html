<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
