<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
