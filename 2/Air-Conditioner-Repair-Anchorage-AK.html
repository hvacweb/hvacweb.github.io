Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
