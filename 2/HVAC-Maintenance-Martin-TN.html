<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>The first ac system and fridges employed combustible or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

When ventilation is not adequate to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air may likewise be an issue.<p>

<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Martin TN?</h3>
<p>The remainder of the HVAC system also requires to be in leading condition for the air conditioning system to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the home. If the individual parts are in appropriate order, the technician can analyze the ductwork for indications of holes, gaps or excessive dirt. Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and offer a cooler house in the hot summertime.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
