<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
