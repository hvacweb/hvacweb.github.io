These convection heaters are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
