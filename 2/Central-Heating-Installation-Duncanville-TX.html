<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Whatever heating unit you set up, it's vital that it's sized properly for your home. Too large and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will utilize too much energy for the amount of heat you want produced. If the system is too little, then your house won't be heated up adequately and the system will need to continuously run to attempt to heat the whole home, which will increase heating bills.<p>

What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
