<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>The installation was fast, professional and extremely well done. The installers were polite and knew precisely what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and recognize easily individuals who are proficient at what they do.

I extremely extremely suggest the two gentlemen as they are outstanding at what they do. Thank you to them as they definitely deserve my thanks and gratitude for a job well done.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
