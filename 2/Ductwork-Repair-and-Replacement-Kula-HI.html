<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might see moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
