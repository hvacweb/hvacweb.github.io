<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner need to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the very same in all other areas.<p>

My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12.
