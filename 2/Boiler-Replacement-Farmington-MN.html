<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in Farmington Minnesota</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>Benefits of Expert AC Repair in Farmington MN</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
