Some dangers are merely inevitable. Some we select to accept since to do otherwise would restrict our ability to lead our lives the way we desire. If we had the opportunity to make informed choices, and some are dangers we might choose to prevent. Indoor air contamination is one risk that you can do something about.<p>

<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was really comprehensive and on-time in discussing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn supplied terrific client service at the end of the visit by explaining precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale methods used by some in the market.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed property owners.

While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
