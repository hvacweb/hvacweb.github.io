<p>Your questions or concerns about indoor air problems can frequently be responded to by the federal government agencies in your state or local government. Obligations for indoor air quality problems are generally divided among many different firms. Calling or writing the firms responsible for health or air quality control is the very best way to begin getting information from your state or local government. To obtain state firm contacts, compose or call EPA's IAQ Information Clearinghouse, (800) 438-4318, (703) 356-4020 in the Washington, D.C. location.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs between $300 to $500 on average. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each room in your home, and if it develops cracks which leak, they need to be repaired. Having defective ductwork makes your system work harder with worse outcomes. Your house will not be adequately cooled, and your energy expenses will go up. Setting up new ductwork for the whole house will cost approximately between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new homes are beginning to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. Some of these styles consist of energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also called air-to-air heat exchangers).
