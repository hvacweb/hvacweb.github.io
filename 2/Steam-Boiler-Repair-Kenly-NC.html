<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a circulation system. Metal pipes are hardly ever utilized due to long-term corrosive concerns.
