<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>Gas Heating in Cumming GA 30040</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence residents. Unlike other types of a/c, evaporative coolers count on the outdoors air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air must be enabled to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to keep and comprehend.<p>
