From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>

<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot beside the radiators.
