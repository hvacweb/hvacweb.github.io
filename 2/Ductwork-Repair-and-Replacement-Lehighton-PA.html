<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in Lehighton PA 18235</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
