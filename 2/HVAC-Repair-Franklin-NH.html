<p>Information provided in this safety guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies.

Exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon becomes caught in concentrations and buildings construct up indoors.<p>
