<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from procedures or items; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
