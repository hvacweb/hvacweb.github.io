Today's heating systems are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which might be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can indicate substantial savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
