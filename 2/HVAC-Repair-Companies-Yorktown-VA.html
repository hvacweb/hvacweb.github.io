Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if needed, update the building envelope. For instance, he might seal spaces and fractures in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more reliable service to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it might suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed just a few years ago.<p>
<p>You could update to the greatest efficiency gear offered and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are just part of the central air conditioning system. The typical house's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air escapes the system.<p>
