Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, sometimes linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems.

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
