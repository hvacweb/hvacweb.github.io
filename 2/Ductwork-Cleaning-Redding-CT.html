<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in collecting info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.
