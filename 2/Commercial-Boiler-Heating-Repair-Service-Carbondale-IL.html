<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, given that it is protected inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical standards eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>

Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
