<p>Correct ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>There are numerous actions a homeowner can require to select items that will avoid indoor air problems from occurring - a number of them are mentioned here. First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, consider using solid wood products. Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, ensure that a reliable moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. If it becomes wet, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>
