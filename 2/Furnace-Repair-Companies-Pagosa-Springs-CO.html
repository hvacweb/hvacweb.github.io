<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
