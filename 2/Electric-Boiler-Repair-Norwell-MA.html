<h3>HVAC repair services in Norwell MA 02061</h3>
<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to decrease the quantity of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, steps must also be required to lessen pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.)

Extra weatherization measures must not be carried out until these problems have actually been corrected.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air.

Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 ought to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>
