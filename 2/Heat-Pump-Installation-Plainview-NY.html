<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a large retailer who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that regularly keeps track of energy intake and temperature levels in shops to save money on costs (particularly at night) and to alert store managers if temperatures in the stores fluctuate beyond an acceptable range that could avoid customers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can afford, so many Seattleites must find methods to combat the heat without a duct system.

<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in location. In addition, the concrete results of a PM is often tough to quantify, as one action specified the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not just break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the outcome of recurring usage of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to holes and fractures. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.  a very helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
