<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Service in Dixon</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold might be living in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center.

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
