<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
