It is a great opportunity; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on rare occasions.<p>
