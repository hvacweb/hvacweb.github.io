<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this.
