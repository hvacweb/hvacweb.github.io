<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on numerous house efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's services and products was impressive. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the needed electrical enhancements to minimize cost.<p>

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
