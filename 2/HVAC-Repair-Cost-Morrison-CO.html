Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely.
