<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, many of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
