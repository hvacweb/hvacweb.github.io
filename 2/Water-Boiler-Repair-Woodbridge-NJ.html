The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide must be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
