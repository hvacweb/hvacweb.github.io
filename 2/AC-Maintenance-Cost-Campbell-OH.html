Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
