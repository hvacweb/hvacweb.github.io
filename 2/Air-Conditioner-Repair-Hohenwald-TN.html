<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise managing the temperature level of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are prone to cold areas", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot beside the radiators.
