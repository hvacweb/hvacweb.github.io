<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, considering that some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>

<p>Making use of air filters can trap some of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable resource section recommends that "Air Purification ought to have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are utilized to minimize the amount of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can act as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can reduce the performance of the coils.<p>
<p>People who are allergic to these contaminants must use allergen-proof bed mattress encasements, wash bedding in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and prevent room home furnishings that collect dust, especially if they can not be washed in hot water. Allergic people should likewise leave your home while it is being vacuumed since vacuuming can really increase air-borne levels of mite allergens and other biological impurities.

Experts advise utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and usually are better suited for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
