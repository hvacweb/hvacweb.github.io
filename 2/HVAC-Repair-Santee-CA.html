<h3>Ways to Get the Most From Your HVAC System at Santee CA</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively simple to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants discharged by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside your home may trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by certified HVAC professionals. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by numerous individuals.<p>
