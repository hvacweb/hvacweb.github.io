<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that best temperature throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those common air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service plan which generally includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
