What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
