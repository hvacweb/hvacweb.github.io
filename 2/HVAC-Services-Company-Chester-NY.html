<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, since the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally just offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability.
