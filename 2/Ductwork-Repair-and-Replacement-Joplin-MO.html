<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
