<p>Inspect these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up.
