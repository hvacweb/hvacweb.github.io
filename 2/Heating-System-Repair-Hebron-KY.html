<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in monthly, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year.
