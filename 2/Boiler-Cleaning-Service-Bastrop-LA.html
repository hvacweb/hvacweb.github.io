<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Winter season utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as 3 months.

For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by numerous people.<p>

(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
