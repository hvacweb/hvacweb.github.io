The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to use. Note: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
