<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
