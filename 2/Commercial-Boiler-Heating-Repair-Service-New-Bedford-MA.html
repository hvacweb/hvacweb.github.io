Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
