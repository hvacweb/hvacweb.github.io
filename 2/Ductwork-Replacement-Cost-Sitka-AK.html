<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. Since it just takes more electrical power to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off prior to it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very handy in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day.

The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
