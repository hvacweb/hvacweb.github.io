My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off prior to it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>

The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.
