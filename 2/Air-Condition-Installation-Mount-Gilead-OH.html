<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
