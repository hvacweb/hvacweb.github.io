<p>As noted, inappropriate temperature level and humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation might also contribute to worker health problems. Temperature levels must range from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by excessive air flow must be avoided. Maintenance of appropriate temperatures and humidity levels and correct air flow will help to minimize the event of upper breathing signs, and, potentially, skin rashes.<p>
<p>. Before picking the installation location of ac system, a number of primary factors need to be considered. First off, the direction of air flow from the indoor units need to not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there must not be any challenges on the way of the air flow that might prevent it from covering the area of the properties as much as possible. The outdoor system should also be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be successfully discharged outdoors and the efficiency of the entire system will drop greatly. It is extremely suggested to install the air conditioner units in quickly available places, for additional maintenance during operation.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more tough to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new homes are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the home. Some of these designs include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also called air-to-air heat exchangers). To find out more about air-to-air heat exchangers, get in touch with the Preservation and Renewable Resource Questions and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
