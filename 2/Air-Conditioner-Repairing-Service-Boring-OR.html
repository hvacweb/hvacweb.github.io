I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
