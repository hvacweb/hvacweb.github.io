<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
