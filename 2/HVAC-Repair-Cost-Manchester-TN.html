(If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
