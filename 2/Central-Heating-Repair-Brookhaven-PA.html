<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise managing the temperature level of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we advise utilizing our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of permitting heat to warm up the concrete slab below.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution.
