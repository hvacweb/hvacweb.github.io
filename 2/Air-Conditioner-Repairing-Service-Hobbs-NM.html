Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place with time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.
