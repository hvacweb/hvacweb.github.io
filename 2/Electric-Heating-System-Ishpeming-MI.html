In a circumstance where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality might have been compromised, mold remediation might be needed. Mold screening and assessments need to be performed by an independent investigator to prevent any conflict of interest and to insure accurate results; free mold testing offered by remediation companies is not suggested.<p>

<h3>Turning to the Right Company for the Right Furnace Repair at Ishpeming MI</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
