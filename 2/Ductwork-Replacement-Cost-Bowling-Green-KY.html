<h3>Central Heating Installation in Bowling Green KY 42101</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
