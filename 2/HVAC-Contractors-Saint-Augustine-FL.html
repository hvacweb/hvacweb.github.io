<h3>Commercial Air Conditioner in Saint Augustine Florida</h3>
<p>If your a/c is more than eight years of ages, repair is probably not worth the expenditure, unless it's an easy problem like particles clogging the condenser unit or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to examine not simply the condition of your existing equipment, however also the ducts that provide the cool air and the total quality of the insulation in your house. Improving those elements might increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than installing new machinery.<p>
<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ issue. Your employer needs to check measurements of air, temperature level and humidity circulation. In addition, assessment and screening of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to make sure it is working according to requirements for developing use and occupancy) ought to be performed. A building walk-through to check for smells and look for water damage, leakages, dirt or pest droppings might be valuable. Leaks require to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can end up being polluted with fungi or germs and require to be removed, also. In some circumstances, specific testing for radon or for asbestos may be needed as part of building tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos requires to be examined every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Start-up," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan should spin. If the compressor starts however the fan does not, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan begins. If  it does not, you have actually provided it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
