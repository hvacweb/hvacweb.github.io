<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Chappaqua NY</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes much more serious with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more traditional type of heating, such as an electrical heater, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used rather of the heatpump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
