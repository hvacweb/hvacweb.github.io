<p>We look at hints before we offer suggestions to change rather than repair a heating unit. One of the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It might be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years ago and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
