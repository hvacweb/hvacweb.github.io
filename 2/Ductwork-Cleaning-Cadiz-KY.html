You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has failed. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are excellent that this might work for one cycle, however the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>

Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Shut off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the a/c service still does not work effectively after you've cleaned the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.
