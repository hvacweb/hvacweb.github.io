<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These products present a risk only when they are handled in a manner that develops dust including asbestos fibers which can be inhaled.

This can lead to the capacity for substantial health problems.<p>
