This is generally used in a third-floor or 2nd area and takes advantage of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the whole surface area of a floor heats the lower half of the space, enveloping residents in warmth at a lower overall temperature level-- in many cases as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heater."
