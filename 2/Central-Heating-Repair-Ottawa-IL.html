<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair at Ottawa IL</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipelines set up under the floor or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
