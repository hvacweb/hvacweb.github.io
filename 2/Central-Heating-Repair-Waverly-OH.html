<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
