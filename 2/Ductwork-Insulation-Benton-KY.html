The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<h3>Boiler Cleaning Service in Benton KY 42025</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit truthful, pleasant and responsive.

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
