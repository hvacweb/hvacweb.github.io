<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
