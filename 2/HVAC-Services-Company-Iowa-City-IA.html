This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
