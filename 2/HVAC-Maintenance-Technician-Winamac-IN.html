<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, considering that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
