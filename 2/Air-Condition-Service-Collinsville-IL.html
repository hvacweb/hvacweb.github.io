<h3>HVAC Technician Near Me in Collinsville IL 62234</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is sincere, trusted, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to find an honest AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
