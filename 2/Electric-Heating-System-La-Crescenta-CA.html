<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
