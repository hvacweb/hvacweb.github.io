<p>Enhance your services, earn more services revenue, and offer an incredible consumer experience. To make certain the unit you choose is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load computation quote to determine the specific type of heat and cooling system that's perfect for your home-we don't simply change it with the exact same size system you currently have.

This action is essential so the unit isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems.
