From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants flowing through your system.

<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely extensive in explaining what services would be carried out.

He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance jobs we might want to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not provide off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off.

Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
