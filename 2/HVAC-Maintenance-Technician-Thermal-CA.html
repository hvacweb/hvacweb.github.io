<p>I normally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
