<p>The heat pump acquired popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can draw out heat from various sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Heatpump transfer heat from outside the structure into the air within.

<p>A specific air conditioner that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c unit in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the exact same air course. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space.

Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is really warmed, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
