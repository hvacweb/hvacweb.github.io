<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements utilized for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more tough to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to offer adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
