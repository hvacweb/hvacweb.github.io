<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
