<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others.

Heaters that kick on often might be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
