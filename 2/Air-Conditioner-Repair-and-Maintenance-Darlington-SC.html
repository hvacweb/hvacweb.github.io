<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
