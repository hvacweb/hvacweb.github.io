<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s below package to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All objects in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, including people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>
