<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
