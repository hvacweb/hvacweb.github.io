<p>There are 2 main kinds of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating business. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are forced to resist existing, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, since it is protected inside your home. When it does require to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
