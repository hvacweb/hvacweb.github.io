<h3>Air Conditioner Repairing Service in Atmore AL 36502</h3>
<p>If you set it too low, you're encouraging the development of mold in wet air. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold growth and contamination. Of course, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the development of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>When choosing which of the best AC units they must install in their houses, there are a couple of main things that house owners will want to take into factor to consider. It actually depends on what you value the most in a leading brand name central air conditioner. The significant aspects for the majority of homeowners will be the overall cost to set up the very best air conditioning system brand names, life-span of the AC unit, warranties provided, energy performance (SEER rankings), and size of the unit you require for your house's square video footage (LOADS) to effectively cool your home.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers depend on the outdoors air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be allowed to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to keep and comprehend.<p>
