<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. Because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize system does not lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
