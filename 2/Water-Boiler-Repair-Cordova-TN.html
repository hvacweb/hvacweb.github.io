<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in gathering information on the phone and offering clear directions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
