<h3>Cheap AC Units in Charleston SC 29412</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are used to seeing this enter the backyards of houses. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box outside of the home. However, there are some internal elements as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling multiple spaces simultaneously, however are not very energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home. At the same time, the con would be that those who use this might spend more cash on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
