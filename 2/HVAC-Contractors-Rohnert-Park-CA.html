<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
