<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have actually been revealed to trigger the health effects mentioned.

<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold.

For instance, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline allergen could cause an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
