Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the overall capability of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Simply put, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not basic, given that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
