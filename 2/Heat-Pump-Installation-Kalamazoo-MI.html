<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
