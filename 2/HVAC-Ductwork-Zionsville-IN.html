<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is frequently crucial to identifying the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such info can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent should request that the company have air monitoring tests carried out.

Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on information might not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
