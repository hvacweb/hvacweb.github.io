<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
