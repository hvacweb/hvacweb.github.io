<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few affordable ones received. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex properly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post install examination results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
