These procedures range from advanced tracer gas techniques used mainly in constructing research study efforts to less involved procedures that can be used by developing operators.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the performance and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor wisely, much of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
