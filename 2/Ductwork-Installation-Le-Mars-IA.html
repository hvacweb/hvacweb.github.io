<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
