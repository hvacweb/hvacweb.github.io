<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor wisely, many of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
