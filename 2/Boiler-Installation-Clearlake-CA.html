<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (including carbon monoxide, radon, unpredictable organic substances ), particulates, microbial impurities (mold, bacteria ), or any mass or energy stressor that can cause adverse health conditions.

Residential systems can further improve indoor air quality by regular cleaning of carpets and rug.<p>
<p>Some health impacts might appear soon after a single direct exposure or duplicated direct exposures to a contaminant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant results are typically short-term and treatable.
