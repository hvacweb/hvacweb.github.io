<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>HVAC Service in Mamaroneck NY 10543</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

CARB likewise sponsors and carries out research into all elements of indoor air quality, with a focus on identifying levels of exposure to hazardous indoor air contaminants, and looking for methods to prevent and minimize that exposure.<p>
