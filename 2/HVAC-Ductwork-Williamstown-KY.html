<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
