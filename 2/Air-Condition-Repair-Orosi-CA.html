If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure.
