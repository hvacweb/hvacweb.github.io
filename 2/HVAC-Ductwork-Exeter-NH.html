<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely useful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.
