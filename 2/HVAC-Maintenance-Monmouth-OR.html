<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested educating me about our system, and left having solved the issue with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part. He was friendly, uncomplicated and a thoroughly satisfying individual to have around that entire time.
