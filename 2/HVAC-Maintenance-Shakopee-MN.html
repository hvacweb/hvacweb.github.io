<h3>Gas Central Heating in Shakopee Minnesota</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Another option to oil heating systems are gas heaters While oil is generally used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have an option in between the 2 types.
