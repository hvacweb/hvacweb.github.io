Heat pumps run on electrical energy and work like ac system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Repair in Derby CT 06418</h3>
<p>Seattle heating systems can run nine months of the year. Based on the average temperatures in our location, if you compared running your furnace to a vehicle it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life expectancy of 15 years. Your heating system will strive for you, but like your car, doing regular and regular maintenance will keep it running smoothly, avoid problems, and keep your warranty intact.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the abilities or tools required to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still essential to have an expert technician examine the system occasionally.<p>
<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't emit heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen in time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
