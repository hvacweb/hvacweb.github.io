<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate terrific however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
