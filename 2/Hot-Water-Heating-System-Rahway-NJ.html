<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Rahway NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Inspect these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
