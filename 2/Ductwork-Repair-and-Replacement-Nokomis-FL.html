<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
