(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still required to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>
