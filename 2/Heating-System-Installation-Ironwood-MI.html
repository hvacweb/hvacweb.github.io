<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product with time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
