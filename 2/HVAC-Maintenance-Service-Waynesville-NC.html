<p>Check these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
