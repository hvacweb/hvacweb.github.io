Structures constantly develop as an outcome of the modifications in the environment around them along with the occupants, materials, and activities within them.

Improperly located outside air intake vents can also bring in air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning unit, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>
