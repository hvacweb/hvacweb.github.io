<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants released by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are uncommonly high inside may trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of co2 in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging long trenches or deep holes to install the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll save money over the long term because of the lower energy expenses. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as conventional air-source systems. The absence of moving parts means you're less most likely to invest big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're considerably more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
