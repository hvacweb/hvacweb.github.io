<h3>Heat Pump Replacement in Edgefield SC 29824</h3>
<p>If you set it too low, you're motivating the growth of mold in wet air. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold growth and contamination. Naturally, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the development of germs and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health.

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
