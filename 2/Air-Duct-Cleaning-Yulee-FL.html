<p>Though it may be difficult to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside.

<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same.

Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and cure-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
