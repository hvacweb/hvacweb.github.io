<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
