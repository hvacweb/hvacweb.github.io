<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
