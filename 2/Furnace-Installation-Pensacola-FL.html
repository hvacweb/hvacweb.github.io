<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
