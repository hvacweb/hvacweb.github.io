<p>My oldest kid always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
