<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
