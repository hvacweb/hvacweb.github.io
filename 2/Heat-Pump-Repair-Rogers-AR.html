<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Rogers AR</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that best temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those typical air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the road. So, make certain to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service plan which usually consists of a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
