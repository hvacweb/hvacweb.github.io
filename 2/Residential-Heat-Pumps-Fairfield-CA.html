Not only was the rate terrific but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
