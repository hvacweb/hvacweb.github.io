<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage.

Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
