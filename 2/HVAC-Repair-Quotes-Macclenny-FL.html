The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air assists and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the home.<p>
