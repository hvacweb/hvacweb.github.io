<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having resolved the problem with a basic repair he did on-site, not changing the entire part. He got along, uncomplicated and a thoroughly pleasurable individual to have around that whole time. His time and expertise to RESOLVE the concern cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a somewhat uncertain diagnostic.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash can be found in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
