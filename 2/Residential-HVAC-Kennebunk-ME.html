<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become airborne, and therefore, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat allergen might cause an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to offer enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
