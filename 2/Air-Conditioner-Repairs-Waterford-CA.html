<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
