<p>The purpose of most structure ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing safety at affordable energy expenses. Load computing is described as the Manual J estimation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or unit cost for air conditioning. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square footage alone, transfer to another contractor. Similar to determining the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, identifying the right size of unit for your house also depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
