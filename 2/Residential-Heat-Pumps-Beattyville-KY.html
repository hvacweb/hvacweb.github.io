<p>A geothermal heater is more trustworthy than options, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy counts on routine sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a reliable and readily available source of energy.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
