<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're closed down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Through normal usage and the unit's existence outside, the coils and fins of the a/c might become really dirty. These aspects of the devices are important for effective air conditioning.

<p>The most typical type of home heater in the U.S. burns gas or propane to produce heat.
