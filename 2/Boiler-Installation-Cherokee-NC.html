<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Cherokee NC</h3>

<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
