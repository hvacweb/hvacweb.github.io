Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead.
