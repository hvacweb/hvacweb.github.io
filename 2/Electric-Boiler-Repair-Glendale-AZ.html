<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on a number of aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether an individual reacts to a toxin depends upon individual sensitivity, which differs greatly from person to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air system is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy effective than models made even 5 years ago, so it makes monetary sense to replace or upgrade your system if it's 5 years of ages or older. The best central air conditioning conditioner you can purchase today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one acquired in 1975 while providing the same amount of cooling.<p>

<p>Additionally, property owners have a variety of choices to select from in powering a floor heating system. Radiant systems work with electrical, gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources.
