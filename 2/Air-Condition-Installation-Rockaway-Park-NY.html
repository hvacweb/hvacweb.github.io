<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ.

Lastly discovered someone to correctly service and the system has actually been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
