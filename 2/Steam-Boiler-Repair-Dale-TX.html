<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
