<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
