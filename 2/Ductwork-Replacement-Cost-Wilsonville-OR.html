We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We selected getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
