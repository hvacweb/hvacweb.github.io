<p>Certain immediate results resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically hard to identify if the signs are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is very important to focus on the time and place symptoms take place. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is far from the location, for instance, an effort needs to be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes.

That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness.
