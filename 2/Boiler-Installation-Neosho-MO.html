Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
