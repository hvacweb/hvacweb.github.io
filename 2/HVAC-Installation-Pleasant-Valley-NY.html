<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is frequently essential to determining the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can sometimes be obtained by requesting copies of air tracking data from the employer. If monitoring data is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent must request that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this information may identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are very low, monitoring data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
