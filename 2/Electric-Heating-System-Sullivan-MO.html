<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
