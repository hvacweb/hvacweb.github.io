<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the unit or flood the area.
