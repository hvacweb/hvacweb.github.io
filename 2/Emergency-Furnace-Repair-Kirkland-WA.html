<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>We often set up little built-in electric space heating systems when we remodel or include on a room. Unlike heat pumps, these systems are self-contained. They are also safe compared to older-style electric baseboard heaters. They come in various kinds: wall-mounted systems that are excellent for small spaces like restrooms, cove heating units that are similar to baseboard heating units however are tucked securely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted radiant heat panels that offer a mild sunshine-like heat from above.<p>
