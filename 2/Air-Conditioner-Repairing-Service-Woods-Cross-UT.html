<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
