The calculation is relatively simple to carry out and will expose what size system you need. If the one you're thinking about wants to figure out the right system for your house entirely on experience, move on to another contractor.

<p>We take a look at clues before we provide advice to replace instead of repair a heating system. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>

That may be an extremely costly dirty-filter diagnosis if the technician comes to your home.
