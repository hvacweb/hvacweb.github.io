<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the conventional hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. It is likely that it is supported by the plumbing if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. Set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be replaced.<p>
