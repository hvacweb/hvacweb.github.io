<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
