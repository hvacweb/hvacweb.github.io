<h3>Benefits of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces at Pinconning MI</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based only on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few sensible ones received. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post install assessment outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
