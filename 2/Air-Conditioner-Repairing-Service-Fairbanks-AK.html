<p>If you are considering installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your house, plan on spending several thousand dollars for the total system. The size of the system figures out the labor hours included to construct the system. To outfit a home with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand name new furnace or more when you consider installation costs upwards of $50 per hour.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. As soon as the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and cure-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
