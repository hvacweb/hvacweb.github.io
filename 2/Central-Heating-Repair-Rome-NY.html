<h3>Heating And Cooling Near Me in Rome NY 13440</h3>

<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was extremely thorough and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Likewise Camryn offered fantastic client service at the end of the consultation by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance jobs we may want to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale methods used by some in the market.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, much of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
