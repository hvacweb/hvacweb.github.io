<p>You might upgrade to the greatest performance equipment readily available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are only part of the central air conditioning system. The average house's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower units, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air gets away the system.<p>

<p>The toxins listed in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health impacts mentioned. However, it is not necessarily real that the results noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels normally found in the home. In many cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health impacts is too limited to determine the levels at which the listed results could happen.<p>
<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from items or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
