If you have actually set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
