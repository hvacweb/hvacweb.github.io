<h3>The Way to Choose An Expert HVAC Technician in Stuart FL</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will require to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
