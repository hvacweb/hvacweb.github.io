Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
