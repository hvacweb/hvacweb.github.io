<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Picture 6).<p>

<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Glens Falls NY Home</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is an extremely enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
