<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing at Santa Fe TX</h3>

I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
