<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
