<p>A specific air conditioning system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning system because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A basic a/c unit transfers heat out of the room since its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, given that all components of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
