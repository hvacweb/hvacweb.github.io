<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps operate on electrical power and work like air conditioning system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating unit (like an area heating system) with the very same quantity of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
