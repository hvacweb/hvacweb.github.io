Consider buying one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly if you buy a brand-new gas stove or range. Never ever use a gas stove to heat your house. When the fireplace is in use, always make particular the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
