<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do.

<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
