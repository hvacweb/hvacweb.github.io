<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can end up being airborne, and hence, are quickly breathed in. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat allergen could induce an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>

Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floors covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
