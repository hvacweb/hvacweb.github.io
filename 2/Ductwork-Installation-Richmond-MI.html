Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the higher temperature levels sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to provide thermal convenience inside.
