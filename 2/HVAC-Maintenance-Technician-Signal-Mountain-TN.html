<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
