<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " top ecological risk to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how hazardous lead might be, it was used in paint, fuel, pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>Most well and city water does not typically consist of lead. Water generally gets lead inside the house from family pipes that is made with lead materials. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked, the only way to understand. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to find out how to get the water checked. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for additional information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
