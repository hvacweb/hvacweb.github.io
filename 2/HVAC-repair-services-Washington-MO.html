<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name. The company started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for decades, till the required for high-efficiency systems required Goettl to end production.

<p>For example, pollutants might collect within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment.

<h3>Passive Ventilation in Washington Missouri</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>

<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly reduces direct exposure to pollutants during cooking.

Constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>
