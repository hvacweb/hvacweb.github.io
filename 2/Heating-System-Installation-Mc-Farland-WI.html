<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company utilized 98% of the existing material purchased with your home. This company presented a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the evaluation on a very cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health hazard factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a new homeowner I have actually discovered how to identify the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
