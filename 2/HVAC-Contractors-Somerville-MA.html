<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do decline them up until they have actually been properly dried. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>

Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately detected, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
