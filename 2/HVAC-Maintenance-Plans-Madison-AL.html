<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily handle the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
