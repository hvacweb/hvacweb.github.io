<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floors, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
