The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their total power must not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit.

<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can afford, numerous Seattleites need to discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to offer enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this.
