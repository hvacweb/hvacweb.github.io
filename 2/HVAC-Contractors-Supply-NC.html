It may likewise include the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to private spaces.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as near your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
