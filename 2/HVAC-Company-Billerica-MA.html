<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it needs from the capacitor. You can generally conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the possibilities are excellent that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>
<p>There is a necessary balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE scores typically come with higher cost. So, make certain to decide based upon how typically you will use your heating unit, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year.

<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
