<p>Oil furnaces are generally not extremely efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however most do not accomplish an efficiency higher than 90%. A few high-end brand names have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more costly, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000.
