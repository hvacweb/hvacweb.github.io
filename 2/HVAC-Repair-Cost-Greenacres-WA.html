<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
