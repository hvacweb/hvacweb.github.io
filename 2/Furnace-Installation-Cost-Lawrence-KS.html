<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Company in Lawrence</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can become clogged with particles that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Unclean filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, changing a furnace and inspecting filter can normally be done in simply a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
