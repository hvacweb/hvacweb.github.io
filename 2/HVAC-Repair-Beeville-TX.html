<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
