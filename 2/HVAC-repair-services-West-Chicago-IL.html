<p>If you are thinking about installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your house, intend on spending several thousand dollars for the complete system. The size of the system determines the labor hours involved to develop the system. To outfit a house with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand new furnace or more when you consider installation fees upwards of $50 per hour.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new houses are starting to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. A few of these styles include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers). For more information about air-to-air heat exchangers, get in touch with the Preservation and Renewable Resource Inquiry and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
