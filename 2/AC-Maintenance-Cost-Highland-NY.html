<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  system rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in automobiles in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by numerous individuals.<p>
