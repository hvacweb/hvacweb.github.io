HVAC specialists suggest following this basic guideline when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's best to purchase brand-new.

Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with only one air conditioning filter need changing more frequently.<p>
