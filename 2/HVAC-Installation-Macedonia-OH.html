<p>There are numerous actions a property owner can take to choose items that will avoid indoor air problems from occurring - a couple of them are mentioned here. First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, think about utilizing solid wood items. Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, ensure that an efficient wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed if it ends up being damp.<p>
