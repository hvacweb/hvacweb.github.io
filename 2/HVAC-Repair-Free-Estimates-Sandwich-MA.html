<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, search for indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can indicate your house might not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, foul-smelling or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To find smells in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
