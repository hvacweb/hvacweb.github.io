<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
