<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget-friendly. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs in between $300 to $500 on average.
