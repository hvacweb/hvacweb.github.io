<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the higher temperatures sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to supply thermal comfort inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold growth and wetness indoors is related to a higher prevalence of resident respiratory problems.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to begin (see Be Client at Start-up," listed below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan ought to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan doesn't. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you have actually offered it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
