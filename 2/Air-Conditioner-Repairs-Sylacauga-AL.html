<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pushed wood items used adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood items made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiber board contains a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood product and is generally acknowledged as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. An excellent location to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Structure Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one element (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>We can recommend the best system for your requirements if you require a new heating or air conditioning unit set up. Why pay extra for a system that over- or under-performs when you can get an ideal fit? And whatever HVAC system you have, we can help keep it running strong with our preventive maintenance strategies. Our techs get to know how your system works so they can identify the subtle changes in efficiency that might be signs of larger trouble down the road.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outdoors air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
