<p>Expert heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately fail. HVAC experts recommend following this fundamental guideline when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in West Islip New York</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the see. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was really happy they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
