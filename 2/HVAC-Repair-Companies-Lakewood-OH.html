<p>Typically the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more affordable technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to supply adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
