<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, there has actually been some promotion recommending that houseplants have been shown to lower levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is currently no evidence, however, that a sensible number of houseplants eliminate considerable amounts of pollutants in offices and houses. Since excessively wet soil might promote the growth of microbes which can affect allergic people, indoor houseplants must not be over-watered.<p>
