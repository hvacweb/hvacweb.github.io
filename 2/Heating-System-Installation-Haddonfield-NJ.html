<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Haddonfield NJ</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in house building is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floorings. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor impurities and helps tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept clean since an air conditioner moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
