<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as important when it concerns central air costs, is the AC unit's size.

On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
