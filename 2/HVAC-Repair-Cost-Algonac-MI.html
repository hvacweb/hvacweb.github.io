<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your Algonac MI Home</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require fairly little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is essential to keep the system operating efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit resemble those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank ought to be checked for leaks, the system must be flushed occasionally to get rid of tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in difficult water areas).

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
