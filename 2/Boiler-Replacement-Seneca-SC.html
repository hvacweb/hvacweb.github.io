<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
