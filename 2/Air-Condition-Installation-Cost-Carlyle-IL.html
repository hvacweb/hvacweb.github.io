<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
