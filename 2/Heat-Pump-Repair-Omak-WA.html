Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation.
