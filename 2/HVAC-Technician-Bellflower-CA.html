<p>The majority of respectable HVAC professionals will offer free estimates with an in-person service call. Beware of HVAC contractors who try to give you a complimentary quote over the phone, as it may not accurately reflect what they will discover when they check out the system. Even if there is a charge for the cost quote, that amount will normally be applied towards your balance due, must you choose to employ that contractor.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as essential when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to properly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and perhaps refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at optimum efficiency and might overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, developing a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy expenses to rise. It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not big enough for your home. If the system is too small, it will need to work harder and might get too hot. Normally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
