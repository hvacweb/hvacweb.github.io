<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services in Douglassville PA</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will require to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
